	"review": "This is my favourite films of the year so far, and there isn't much time left for it to be beaten. You'd think it wouldn't be that rewatchable, but I've now seen it four times since it came out in February. It has everything I liked about part one, but with some added romance and comedy, and with a little less standing around in concrete bunkers. The decision to keep Jessica pregnant for two whole epic sci-fi movies is a strange one, but I can see how introducing Alia might be an even stranger distraction from what this movie is trying to achieve. It doesn't have many knock-on effects except that Paul can't have a son faster than Jessica's pregnancy. The performances are all great, and Javier Bardem especially is a joy to watch in this. The soundtrack is even better than in part one too. Just an incredible movie in all aspects. Where you you keep your family atomics?",
