    "review": "Christmas movies are inherently rewatchable because Christmas is a time of repetition. Many people and families watch the same movie each year as they form their own traditions. This is my favourite christmas movie and I don't watch it every year, but I enjoy it immensely every third Christmas or so. It's got a hint of magic, community spirit, a reminder of those less fortunate out in the cold, jokes, emotion, and a happy ending. It's incredibly wholesome while also functioning as a social commentary of some of the issues facing Japan. The buildings in the background sometimes look like faces mirroring the emotions of the scene. At one point, lights in the windows form health bars like in <i>Street Fighter</i>.#sThe bit where Gin tries to close the eyelids of a dead man and he wakes up always makes me laugh.#d",
