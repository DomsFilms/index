	"review": "The typical complaints about this are the culturally insentive parts, and how much of a burden Willie is. It's hard to disagree with those flaws, but the older it becomes, the more I think of it like any other problematic old movie. How long until it gets a free pass for being a <i>product of its time</i>? On the plus side, the opening, the argument, and the minecart chase are all-time Indy highlights. There's a mix of beautiful matte paintings, and terrible-looking overlaid effects, to bring India to life. I appreciate the chance to spend more time hanging out with Indy, even if we don't learn anything new about his personality or backstory. It's my third favourite, and I was surprised when I checked online and found a huge variation in nerd's rankings. I had assumed everyone thought {Raiders of the Lost Ark} was a triumph, and that every subsequent film could only grasp for made it great. Surprisingly, the real three come up in all sorts of different orders in other people's opinions. The only near constant is that the new ones can't capture the magic nearly as well.",
