	"review": "Nobody else could have made this film, or achieved anything like this. It's far from perfect, but if you like experiencing completely new things and seeing the boundaries of a medium get pushed in new directions then it's definitely worth seeing. I think I've seen it rather too many times now and I'll try to stay away for a long time. There isn't quite enough music for my tastes, and it feels very long when scenes drag on accompanied only by ambient buzzing, but I do think all the ethereal whooshing is a necessity to evoke the right atmosphere. It depicts so much sex and suffering that it seems gratuitous, and it could probably have done with fewer examples, to make some time to examine the important plot beats more deeply. We see Oscar's whole life, but he never has any hopes or dreams. He is just swept along and twisted around by the turbulence around him, until the world is abruptly done with tormenting him. None of the characters seem smart, and not all of the performances are particularly convincing, but it mightn't have worked with any characters offering a voice of reason or making rational decisions. Is this really non-linear storytelling? Or are we simply experiencing memories and spiritual connections in the order they are surfacing in Oscar's consciousness? Not a horror, but often horrifying.",
