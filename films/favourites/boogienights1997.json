	"review": "Like {Goodfellas} but with adult movie starts instead of gangsters, it follows the rise, addiction and fall of a man who thinks the world is his oyster. At first, living outside of society's rules is fun and exciting, and he finds a surrogate family to support him when he's alienated from his parents. But there's very little security or redemption in his world, and he's going down a road he can't easily turn away from once it's part of his identity and reputation.Every character in this movie is dumb, but in a way that's what brings them together. John C. Reilly's character is basically a slightly more successful version of his character from {Step Brothers}. While they're on the way up, partying and making money, everyone wants to hang out at Jack's house. Once things start going wrong, people stop showing up, and they are more interested in using cocaine with the curtains closed during the daytime. It suffers a bit in rewatchability for getting dark during their comedown, but...",
	"spoilers": "It ends with a surprisingly wholesome family happy ending. They each hit rock bottom in their own ways, but they still have each other. The squares will never get them, even if they're hypocritically consuming the content, but they've become a family for each other. The world will always want more of their films, so if they can put their troubles behind them, the dream can continue.",
