    "review": "It isn't that popular in the UK as a Christmas tradition movie. Maybe our equivalent is <i>Mary Poppins</i> or <i>The Great Escape</i>. Apart from how rude some characters are towards women, including butt-patting, it's aged beautifully and will continue to do so. Getting a child to sit through a black and white movie is probably impossible now, but adults will always be able to enjoy it. My only problem with it is that it's repetitive; we see so many examples of each aspect of the plot, played out with each citizen of Bedford Falls. George has to show his selflessness in so many different ways, have his dreams of travel quashed repeatedly. Then he has to meet everyone he knows before he finally accepts he's in a world where he never existed, then he meets everyone again when all is fixed in the world. Maybe you could cut out 50% and tell the same story, but I do cry at the ending, and the time spent telling the story probably contributes towards that emotional heft. It has surprisingly clear socialist views, but at the end of the day the real winner is Mr Potter, who expands his wealth by owning the means of production and stealing $8000 from the working townsfolk without a shred of remorse. You can watch it every year, but if you do then you might sometimes feel like you're going through the motions and just waiting for that ending.",
