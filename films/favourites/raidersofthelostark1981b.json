	"review": "Just constant excitement from start to finish. If you find this while channel hopping you have to watch it, and once you're sucked in, there no dull moment to go for a pee break. You can watch this every year and never get bored. The textbook example of an action adventure. I love the meta jokes about the nonsensical plot, and about how handsome Harrison Ford is for history professor. It has this perfect balance of sillyness and credibility, for the plot and characters, that they increasingly lost track of with each subsequent film. Marion is just right in terms of reacting squeamishly to the skeletons and snakes, while also standing up for herself. Indy has to save her, as the hero, but she doesn't exist just to be saved like some action heroines of the time.",
