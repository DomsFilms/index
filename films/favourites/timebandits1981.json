    "review": "I find a lot of the supporting characters and their jokes really funny in this, but Kevin and the bandits are not so funny. It's like a film for all the family, where children will like the adventure, and adults will like the historical figures making jokes about taxation and religious freedoms. It's episodic nature meant it really could have been a TV show, and now that it finally is, we have a loving homage in series form that's the closest you can get to a modern day {Monty Pyton}.",
    "spoilers": "Blowing up Kevin's parents at the end for essentially no reason is such a {Monty Python} joke. Nobody else has ideas like that in movies. My favourite joke was when the supreme being rehired the bandits with \"a 19% cut in salary backdated to the beginning of time.\"",
