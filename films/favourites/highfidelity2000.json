    "review": "If Ferris Bueller or William Miller (<i>Almost Famous</i>) grew up to run a record store. This is based on a British book, set in London, so I can image a terrible Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant adaptation that's more like a broad rom-com. There's certainly some <i>Bridget Jones</i> in it, but it's mixed with a good helping of <i>Black Books</i> and <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>. Unlike most rom-coms it's targeted more towards men, with a deep understanding of our psyche. Cusack is stupendous, and the supporting characters are all very well realised too. It's full of music easter eggs and jokes to pick up on multiple viewings, but I don't think it's particularly rewatchable as the unpredictable ending is such an important part of the plot, and the film's appeal as a whole. The fashion in this movie is <i>so</i> late 90s that Laura wears a purple sheer dress over a tank top to her father's funeral.",
