    "review": "Some films are mediocre in every category and deserve a 5/10. Some elements of this were great and others were poor. Does it also deserve a 5? It seems crude to reduce a piece of art down to a single number. In similar stories of 80s kids adventuring on their bikes (Stand By Me, Stranger Things season one) you have plenty of low intensity scenes near the start to get used to the small town and it's characters. You bond with them by seeing them live out their lives in a normal way. Every scene in this has maximum drama right from the start: boy is horrifically murdered, boy is forced to slaughter an animal, girl is bullied at school, boys are bullied at school, father yells at son about family tragedy, boy is victim of racial hate crime. The first scene to show restraint in this film is when the kids swim together 43 minutes in. Some horror films get away with constant tension but this is trying to be a serious drama too, and it was too melodramatic for me to enjoy. It is also too long a film for that level of intensity. Every single time a character was alone they encounter a scary entity. It was predictable and every time they split up I thought \"now I have wait for them to creep around, get spooked and run away, before the story can progress\". At least it looked and sounded good. I liked the way Pennywise moved.",
