    "review": "The idea of placing this type of monster in a bland, modern environment is great. Incorporating bullies, financial stress, a desparate parent and children's innocence are all neat touches that make the film more suspenseful without just adding more explicit horror elements. It loses some scary points for being cute, but it's a great film. I look forward to seeing the English version. My sister's cat used to stare at this film weirdly.",
