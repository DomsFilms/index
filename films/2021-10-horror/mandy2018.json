    "review": "Beautiful, psychedelic, amusingly over-the-top. I love the pacing of this film. It's my favourite Nicolas Cage movie and shows he is a legitamately good actor. Much easier to enjoy than Beyond The Black Rainbow, but similar in many ways, such as the lighting and the great casting of freakish-looking people. The shot where it fades between Mandy's face and Jeremiah's is my favourite part.",
