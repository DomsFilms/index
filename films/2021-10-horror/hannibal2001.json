    "review": "Maybe this is because I've seen a lot of schlock in the last couple of days but this seems overly pretentious and like it's trying too hard. The cast is really good and it's as though each individual scene is gripping and well acted, but as a whole it's too slow and meandering. Gary Oldman and Giancarlo Giannini's characters aren't used to their full potential. There's no cohesion, compared to The Silence Of The Lambs that follows a more typical crime thriller formula.",
