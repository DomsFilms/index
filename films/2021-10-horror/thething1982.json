    "review": "A fantastic film. I think of this film as being very similar to <i>Alien</i>, due to its time of release, it's tone and it's premise of being locked in with the monster. I prefer <i>Alien</i> but this isn't far behind. The soundtrack is great. The setting is unique. It's so tense and unpredictable. There is a great episode of <i>The X-Files</i> (S01E08) also based on Who Goes There? which is just like this.",
