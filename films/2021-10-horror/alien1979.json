    "review": "Looks amazing for the 70s, with gorgeous lighting and sets. Sound design and soundtrack is great. I like how well it predicts future technology (2001 is the king of this). The body horror hasn't aged very well and my grusome rating is unforgiving of outdated unrealistic special effects. This is one of my favourite films ever.",
