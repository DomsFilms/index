    "review": "Like the first one, it had me shaking in my boots as I explored some horrible dark houses with cluttered basements. I liked the opening scene a lot, where it barrages you with a hail of jump scares, so you know what you've gotten yourself into. I like Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson in this series; it seems uncommon that the main haunted characters are professionals who know how to stay calm. It's not a great drama but clearly its main objective is to make you jump, rather than take you on an emotional journey, and it is successful in that regard.",
