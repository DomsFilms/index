    "review": "Beautiful and slow, brooding. It's about a woman who goes around staring at stuff and doing ambiguously witchy things. It does a good job or conveying the sense of being an outcast, having mysterious power and being guided by an unseen force. Quite arty with little dialogue. Not for everyone but I like this kind of thing. The lead actress is good.",
