    "review": "This is very consistent with the tone of The Shining, although it doesn't have the same dazzling filmography. It has plenty of references to the original and continues Danny's story in a thoughtful way while introducing unique new concepts. In a way it's like an edgy supernatural HBO drama. I didn't have to think too hard and that's ok. I liked it a lot.",
