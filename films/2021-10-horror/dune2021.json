    "review": "Wow this stole so many ideas from <i>Tremors</i>. The two films were basically indistinguishable. This is really loud and epic; clearly made for the cinema and with great sound design. The sets are really sparse, like every interior is an empty concrete room and every exterior is the desert. Yet it remains visually interesting because of the the way the light hits all the smoke, dust and fog they used. Not actually a horror film in any way.",
