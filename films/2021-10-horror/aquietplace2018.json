    "review": "I thought I would get bored of the premise, as it runs through all of the jeopardy of making a noise and being killed right at the start before the title card is shown. I wondered if the stakes would be somehow raised after that or if it would be like a bad survival story where everyone is picked off in the same way one by one. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the character development was and I really enjoyed it. Like <i>Alien</i>, they don't let you see the monster clearly until the end. Emily Blunt is great in it. I don't think I want to see the sequel any time soon as I wouldn't want it's silence gimmick to wear out.",
