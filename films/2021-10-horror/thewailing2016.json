    "review": "I found this riveting. It's extremely tense and mysterious almost all the way through, except for some strangely wacky comedic scenes near the start. We learn the protagonist is a little dumb and clumsy; odd traits for such a serious and dark film. The plot is unlike anything anything I've seen before and it always keeps you guessing: what kind of monster plagues the village, who is evil, who is possessed? It features an amazing child actress, beautiful scenery and a great soundtrack.",
