    "review": "A crazy unique idea that should've been better. It's like a Twilight Zone, X Files or Black Mirror episode, but in Black Mirror it would have been better executed. It relies almost exclusively on the arguments and reasoning of strangers in a single set, and so needed a better script. It mentions lots of maths but often gets it wrong; it would have been more satisfying if there was real attention to detail there. It was probably more exciting and novel when it was new, but I still enjoyed it having gone in blind.",
