    "review": "Some people say <i>The Matrix</i> is all style and no substance. I disagree and I think this film proves it. It is extremely similar to <i>The Matrix</i> stylistically, but... it's a a load of old shit. It's amazing how many surface level similarities there are between the two, but this film loses in every comparison. The dialogue all seems so bad in this. I'm no action movie aficionado but the action here is somehow unenjoyable; maybe it's the sound design, choreography, lack of variety or jeopardy. Positives: Bill Nighy's character is unintentionally quite funny. I like the band with the same name, with no other relation.",
