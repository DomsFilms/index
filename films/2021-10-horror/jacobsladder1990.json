    "review": "I've watched a lot of films about people succumbing to mental illness in the last few days. I'm getting a little tired of the tropes: scenes don't line up, the story jumps back and forth in time, things get weird before the character wakes up in a cold sweat. Having said that, this film executes them very well. There are plenty of scary and unsettling parts. One of the advantages of madness is that you don't need to have any consistency in the scary scenes or monster design. This has lots of unrelated creepy goings on but that's OK. The soundtrack and filmography are maybe a little dull but the tone matches the subdued personality of the protagonist. Some good acting on display here. I could have sworn Macaulay Culkin was in this but he's not in the credits so maybe I was hallucinating.",
