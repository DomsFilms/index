	"review": "The farmers are both good performances, and the best thing about the film. I was wondering why they don't have many sheep, considering how much land they have access to. But I am not an expert and maybe they're bottlenecked by manpower rather than grazing acreage. Maybe the location doesn't actually function as a farm and only a certain number of sheep could be transported there for filming. It starts with the inherent horror of mammalian birth, but then the lamb itself is so weird that it's hard to feel any kind of suspense.  It's basically not a horror movie, but a surreal drama and an agricultural genetic mystery. The ending only felt cheesy to me, leaving me with lingering questions about the conception of the lamb that overshadow any other thoughts about the film as a whole.",
