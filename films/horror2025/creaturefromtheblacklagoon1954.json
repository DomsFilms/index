	"review": "I don't believe in the creature from the black lagoon; I think it's just a man in a costume! It starts with a surprisingly gripping lecture explaining the premise, but everything that comes next is just a very simple monster movie. Julie Adams is very beautiful, even on her long jungle expedition without access to a hair dryer. The best scenes are all underwater ones, and so I didn't mind when there were two swimming scenes back to back with similar music, even with the same music. You could argue they were filling time by showing the two divers in the river, followed by the woman, both on leisurely swims while the creature lurks undetected below. I like how they use ancient fish species that match the missing link theme: lungfish, bichirs and gars. Untimately, too much of this film is just a grasping monster hand from behind a wall, and the ending is not at all satisfying.",
