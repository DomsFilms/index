	"review": "So unbelievably densely packed with gags and references, especially in the first act. I was considering listing a bunch of things I noticed or remembered this time, but it would end up as a huge messy paragraph. That's no way to write a review. It's funny how fragile the zombies are; the moment you turn, your limbs become very loosely attached and a swing ball pole will go straight through you like you're made of sponge cake. One of my favourite scenes is when Dylan Moran is completely torn apart, in a way that's funny, surprising, gross and satisfying. By the end it does turn into rather a generic zombie survival story. If it did something a bit more exciting, or kept the cadence of jokes, towards the end, it would be as good as {Hot Fuzz}.",
