	"review": "Look, it's a 1980s black and white 4:3 nearly dialogue-free Japanese body horror art film, and that not going to be for everyone. But if you are excited by that description, this will absolutely deliver for you. It's hard to imagine how a film meeting all those criteria could be any better. There's an almost interpretive dance quality to it, which I loved, along with some brilliantly vulgar physical comedy. It's accompanied by an abrasive score that perfectly matches the visuals, and a lot of the body horror comes from sound effects that emphasise the harm on display. Mercifully it's hardly more than one hour. It had me squirming in my chair during the first scene, and is so densely packed with unpleasantries from then on, that it felt exhausting by the end.",
