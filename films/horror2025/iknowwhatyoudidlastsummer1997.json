	"review": "At the time it was probably considered a typical teen horror, but it was also kind of influential and starts off like a fun time capsule now. The fun quickly runs out when you realise it's on the same level as some of the worst {Friday the 13th} sequels, but will less imaginative and visceral kills. The titular letters are lame props, used in the most predictable way. It's clearly a cash in on the popularity of {Scream}, but without any of the jokes or self-parody that made it fun. There is such intense sub-bass rumble in the score, during jump scares and also continuous suspenseful buildups, that it hit resonant frequencies of my living room windows and doors that I've never experienced before. One of the {Big Bang Theory} cast is in this, and he looks genuinely young, being in his early 20s when it was filmed. It's strange to see him like this, when he's most famous for a sitcom full of actors in their 40s trying to appear like they're in their 20s.",
