	"review": "This sucked, but it did have some cool costumes and body transformation scenes. The sound mixing was horrible, and they used the same exact sound effect about 30 times for those claws. There are a lot of love/erotic scenes and the same musical sting is inserted into every single one, including a totally inappropriate traumatic memory moment. I was shocked by the difference in talent and care given to different aspects of the process. Sets and costumes a success, editing and face acting a disaster.",
