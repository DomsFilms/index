	"review": "It makes you ask yourself where you would realistically draw the line, but it's a hard decision because even if you have been in a similar situation, the stakes won't have been anything like this. Maybe you have met people exactly like this, but because you're here reading my dumb website it means you made the right choice before you realised what the consequences could have been. It's like Funny games but more subtle and intelligent, but also more extreme by the end. I dread to watch the American remake, because it probably has a car chase and some action scenes in it, and none of the funny European personality types. This one earns a such a high score because of how well it stays with you, and how much you will want to talk about it with your sicko horror friends afterwards.",
