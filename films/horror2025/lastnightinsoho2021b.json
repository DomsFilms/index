	"review": "It's just so entertaining and fun that I wanted to see it again. I think music-based movies are easier to rewatch in general. It's a dark story but with a little too much {Doctor Who} style cheese and it only really leans into horror towards the end. There's some very creative CGI, and the Caf√© de Paris scene where they keep swapping places is the best example of that. The exaggerated bumpkin living situation at the start makes me laugh. She talks about London like she's moving to <i>Somalia</i>. I think this film would have been better if Matt Smith had a moustache, and I see no reason to elaborate on this matter any further.",
	"spoilers": "The ending twist is disappointing in a {Midsummer Murders} kind of way: it ignores all previous clues, and the obvious suspect, revealing a surprise perpetrator who delivers and exposition dump and then manufactures an action/rescue scenario where there's no doubt who will survive.",
