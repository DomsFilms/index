The effects are great, the strange story and setting, despite being a little disjointed, keeps you guessing the first time you see it. I'm keeping the score at an 8, but I think I liked it slightly more on second viewing. There is maybe one too many finale-like moments at the end about wondering if someone survived, or giving a last knowing look, or striving to make a plan work. It starts to feel like an action movie. The photo the well camera produces is cool, but we have already just seen that character escape in what felt like a climactic moment, and now we're seeing them struggle to achieve something else immediately afterwards.",
