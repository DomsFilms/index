	"review": "The child segment was like a half remembered traumatic memory. Did it really happen, or was it augmented by her imagination? It captures children's fascination with locked doors and their wrinkly grandparent's skin. The teenage segment highlights her mother's jealousy, that her daughter now gets more attention from men, and how that attention can flip between pride to fear in a moment. The adult segment was hardest to understand, but also had a brilliantly gruesome ending. It's basically an anthology of short wordless horror films. Usually if there's a segment without dialogue between two conventional ones in an anthology, then it works well to break things up, but three in a row is a little hard to stay engaged through.",
