	"review": "Crucially, it sounds great, and uses sounds and music in an interesting way. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and neither did the protagonist. It uses Italian without subtitles to make you feel alienated and confused like he does, and it definitely succeeds that way. It was just a little frustrating that it didn't have much of a pay-off, and it also didn't descend towards as much violence and gore as I hoped.",
