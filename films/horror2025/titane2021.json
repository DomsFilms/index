	"review": "I saw this once before a couple of years ago, and although it felt like difficult film to wrap my head around at the time, I now realise it has been burned into my brain since then. It's maximally grotesque, not through violence or deaths, but in the unique stresses and transformations of the human body it features. Somehow despite all the body horror, one scene that makes me squirm the most is that dance for the fire station crew. But that's not to say I made it through the nose bit, the taping bit, or the tangled hair bit unscathed. The two leads are fantastic, and somehow when Adrian's mother shows up she delivers a perfect performance with about 3 minutes of screen time. Julia Ducournau's new film is out soon, and I hope it's good, but the response from early screenings has be worried. These are big swings, and it's very likely she'll miss eventually.",
