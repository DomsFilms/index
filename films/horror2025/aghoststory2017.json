It wasn't on a corner and there weren't trees or buildings blocking the oncoming road. Afterwards, it turns into a sort of Terrence Malicky journey through life's most emotional moments. Individually, many of them were impressive, but I didn't feel like it came together as a whole to say anything to me.",
