It had the feel of a Sci-Fi/SyFy original, with young actors getting as melodramatic as possible with a lazy script, out in the countryside, with hardly any props, hardly any moving camera shots. The difference is that there isn't even the threat of an incoming megalosharktopus to rip these idiots apart. It looks like one of us is a killer! Let's split up!",
