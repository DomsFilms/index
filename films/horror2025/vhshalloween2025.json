	"review": "None of the segments were disappointing, but I saw this with a group of people and we all agreed which two of the five we liked the least. The other three were really great as far as V/H/S goes: {Coochie Coochie Coo}, {Fun Size} and {Home Haunt}. Also the interlude parts were joyous nuggets of gratuitous head-explosions and projectile vomit effects. I foolishly watched the trailer beforehand, which reveals far too many of the visual surprises this has to offer. I will always watch the new V/H/S every year regardless of quality, so the trailer wasn't made for me anyway.",
