	"review": "There's a strange mix of shouting and whispering in this film that kept me on edge. It's a story about gaslighting and exerting power over a young woman, but as I watched I wasn't sure where the socially acceptable misogany of the time ended, and the horror-inducing line was crossed. Visually it is attractive but not that captivating, except for Mia Farrow who you can't take your eyes off of. Her performance is the real highlight, especially in terms of body language and physicality. I knew she was quirky, but while writing this I looked her up and learned she had four biological and ten adopted children! There are more entertaining and deep modern equivalents (think {Hereditary}) and that pushes the score down a little, as being surpassed reduces the timeless quality.",
