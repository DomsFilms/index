	"review": "At the start I couldn't stop thinking about the contrived premise, as it launches into the walk without much exposition. I wondered about the rules, and how I would strategise if I had to do it. Eventually I stopped noticing that they were always walking and just became absorbed in the drama. Really it's a film about a handful of young men talking about life and death in a time where there isn't much to life for, like a hangout movie, except there is an emotional death scene every few minutes. They give in one by one, regardless of their strategy or the rules or the cultural effect of the walk as a televised event. The ending didn't even focus on what finishing the walk does to someone. David Jonsson was especially great. Cooper Hoffman was solid, but he didn't exactly look like a guy who'd been training his body for a physical challenge. It's enjoyable as long as you don't scoff to hard at how silly the walk actually is.",
	"spoilers": "The Major's son twist was disappointing. It played out just like how I expected, after being heavily alluded to at the start. It also had no wider ramification for the other characters. When Stebbins described himself as \"the rabbit\", I thought for a moment he was revealing that he was somehow a plant who was predestined to win. That would have been more interesting, although I'm not sure how it would have been physically possible.",
