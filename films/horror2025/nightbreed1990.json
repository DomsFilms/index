	"review": "It's a dark fantasy thriller with a big action set piece at the end. I enjoyed it and it kind of reminded me of {Hellboy}. For no reason other than our entertainment, each of the nightbreeds was a different type of monster with wildly different costumes. I liked it a lot when that guy exploded in the sun. David Cronenberg is good in an acting role here.",
