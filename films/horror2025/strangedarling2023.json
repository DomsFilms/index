	"review": "I found the chapter 1 encounter very frustrating. Both sides give mixed messages, and I know one of them is a serial killer, but based on their actions in that chapter alone, I'm on on the guy's side. It's like the darling (strange) was doing everything possible to be difficult and focussing on her own uncontrolled emotions in a frustratingly inconsiderate way. Even if it's not intentional, she's clearly going through something I would be desperate to stay away from. It doesn't start with chapter 1, and I thought they pulled that move off in a really clever way. If you like {Gone Girl} or {No Exit} then you will vibe with this. American adults seem curiously into jigsaw puzzles, or as they unhelpfully call them, \"puzzles\". They don't offer any satisfaction to me, but always consume a lot of time. I group them into the same category as colouring books for adults; just drown your pancakes in squirty cream and let the clock move forwards without having a single thought. As a meditative exercise it could have value, but I wouldn't want to do it as a team, and I wouldn't want to pay for them or dedicate storage space to the boxes. Painting by numbers is slightly more worthwhile because it might help develop skills with a brush without the possibility of being unsatisfied with your work. Ultimately there are so many videogames I'd like to play, but don't have the time for, that it frustrates me to see other people get sucked into time sinks that I don't understand or respect. Anyway, great movie, nice use of twists born of non-linear storytelling. Thrillers like this often don't hold up to rewatches: that's not what they're for. Just enjoy, and move on.",
