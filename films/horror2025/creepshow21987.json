	"review": "Every segment is so dumb, but they're also all fun and I enjoyed my time with it. It didn't feel like they had reduced the budget or run out of ideas only having three, because of the substantial animated interludes, and the way the used the extra time in each segment well. The last one with the hitchhiker was the best in my opinion, and the first one with the wooden statue was the worst, only because the horror turn in it was too simple. I suppose the comic book style presentation in {Creepshow} was a little better than in this one.",
