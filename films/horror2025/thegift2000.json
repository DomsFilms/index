There was a great courtroom scene, but that was the peak for me, and it fizzled out in a way that left me feeling a little bored. It did this thing that annoys me in films, where there are constant flashes of lighting during a storm. There was water on the ground but no rain falling, and they were flashing a light every 5-10 seconds with no delay before the thunder sound. Just because you can do this, you don't have to have it in every shot of a conversation! I suppose, because the flash is done during filming, it's hard to adjust how many there are in the edit.",
