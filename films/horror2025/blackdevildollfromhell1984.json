	"before": false,
	"review": "Filmed on VHS, using the microphone built into the camera, and probably edited in-camera too; from a technical perspective it's the worst film I've ever seen. The black devil doll is a ventriloquist puppet who represents the evil temptation of masturbation among religiously celibate individuals, and it was absolutely not a story that needed to be told, especially in this format. I know that this is on this year's {Halloween Best of the Worst Spooktacular}, so the real enjoyment will come from seeing a professional critical analysis of it later.",
