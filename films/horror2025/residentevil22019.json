	"review": "It's a bit lopsided, in that the police station is fantastic, and the sewers and lab are half-hearted by comparison. The only part of the sewers that resembles the police station gameplay is the chess piece puzzle, which would have been better suited in the lab anyway. I think it would have made more sense to have two larger puzzle-filled locations separated by an exciting and linear sewer segment. Regardless, I loved almost everything about the game. The writing and voice acting made me nostalgic for 90s games and action movies, but the graphics and gameplay are some of the best I've experienced in recent years. The zombies, and their animations, looked particularly good in the stark light of the character's torch. The boss fights are merely serviceable, with some dodgy hitboxes, and movesets too limited to be scary or unpredictable. Other than that it's a blast from start to finish.",
