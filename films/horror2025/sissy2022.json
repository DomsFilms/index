	"review": "Starting off with social cringe-based horror, I don't like any of the characters, but it doesn't matter because second hand embarrassment doesn't require empathy. At some point it transforms suddenly into a slasher and all that tension between characters is thrown away. It becomes a parade of grizzly murder scenes. It's disjointed in that way, and although they try to tie it all together in the third act, it didn't quite land for me. It's still fun, and does some new things simply by embracing gen Z culture in a way that other movies haven't started to do yet.",
