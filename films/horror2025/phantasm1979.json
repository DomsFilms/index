	"review": "I thought this would be a schlock comedy horror like {Brain Damage}, but it has a more serious and surreal tone. By that I mean: I had no idea what was going on, and neither did the filmmakers. Individual scenes are interesting, but they're just disparate ideas that don't come together as a whole to make any kind of coherent plot. I know it's meant to be based on dream logic, but I am not going to give a film credit for pulling the <i>and it was all a dream</i> card at the end without tying it into any message or themes. There are some absolutely shocking line reads, but the effects are good, so let's say these two unrelated notes cancel each other out while judging the film's quality. It's as though they came up with the effects first, and then threw together a  story that could contain them. Two crazy parts that stood out to me were a bungled {Dune} reference where they say \"fear <i>is</i> the killer\" with such conviction that I can only assume it was a mistake, and a gun safety lecture from a guy who immediately chambers a round in his handgun and then puts it in his butt crack.",
