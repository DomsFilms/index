	"review": "The landscapes here are amazing, as is often the case for westerns, but I feel like that must be easy to do when shooting on location in these parts of the world. Even the disappointing films, like this one, can still dazzle you with a good mountain or two. The dialogue is a little too cheesy, the characters aren't that deep, and their motivations are far too simple even if it is part of the plot. I did spend time thinking about plot holes while watching, for example: why did Colqhoun lead them all the way back to the cave, when he could have had access to the knife at any other time? It made me want to watch {True Grit}, a modern western that gets everything right. But alas, it's nothing but horror for me until November. It also reminded me of {Interview with the Vampire}, although that might just be superficial due to the hair, costumes and vampire-like recruitment themes. The music in the first half was broadly enjoyable and appropriate for the setting, but in the second half they make the strange choice of switching to electic organ and synth music. Some of it works and some feels incongruous. The final battle music the most memorable, and it's great. I have to say it's hard to watch Jeffrey Jones now, and I don't understand why he is still landing roles. Finally, it's not nearly as grotesque as it should have been for a cannibalism movie.",
