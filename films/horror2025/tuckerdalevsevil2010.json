There is this one sitcom <i>big understanding</i> joke, told over and over for the entire runtime. Conceptually it's neat, poking fun at the genre's tropes like those other movies do. They just forgot to add any variation or character development, taking that one idea that would have fit within a TikTok skit, and hammering it home until I was almost angry. Towards the end I kept checking how much longer I had left to watch. Tucker and Dale themselves are acceptable performances for a comedy, while the kids behave like background extras in the Rebecca Black {Friday} video. After scrabbling around for a an unqualified compliment, all I can find to say is that the kills look decent and have a fun amount of gore. Ultimately I found it less funny or enjoyable than the much lower budget and older slashers it is trying to spoof.",
