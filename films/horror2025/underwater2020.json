	"review": "What a strange horror movie. There's no build-up, no setting of the scene. You don't learn anything about the characters or location before the horror scenario starts, leaving the characters with no motivation except to survive. It looks cool and is a thrill ride kind of movie, but without any emotional stakes I'm sure it will be totally forgettable. The high budget and famous cast are a little wasted this screenplay. I think if you want to make a space walk or deep sea dive scary, you can't cut so quickly. Long and atmospheric POV shots are best. It takes time to build tension, and this movie is far too impatient. In reality the human  body needs time to adjust to pressure changes, but here they happen in seconds, mid-conversation. The whole affair could, and should, have been a 15 minute episode of {Love Death + Robots}, and the same setting is utilised far better in the videogame {SOMA}.",
