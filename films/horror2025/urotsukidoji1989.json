	"review": "I'm just going to have to tell it like it is; This movie was made by combining only the story parts of an otherwise heavily erotic horror anime series. It was censored and shortened for this western theatrical release. It doesn't particularly make sense, as I suspect some important character development moments happen during the scenes I'm not allowed to see. I thought the monster design and lore was cool, and it made me realise I want to see more hand-animated horror, but ideally not in such a cursed subgenre.",
