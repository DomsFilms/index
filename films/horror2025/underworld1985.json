It turns out the band really was named after a horror movie, this one! Unfortunately this also sucks. There was a bar in Reading that had an old CRT TV in a fireplace, forever showing wonky old VHS B movies and cult classics, muted in lieu of the music they played. The best thing I can say about this is that it has the right vibes for that fireplace: low budget but ambitious filmmaking, and something to look at without actually following. I watched it with the sound <i>on</i> and that was a mistake. The dialogue, and reading of each line, was atrocious. I was glad when it ended.",
