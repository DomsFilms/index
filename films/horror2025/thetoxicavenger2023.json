	"review": "I was disappointed by how slowly this moved. It was as though every shot lingered too long, every scene dragged, and that is a real problem for a film that attempts to put comedy first. I can imagine a fan-made edit that's 30 minutes shorter, without any scenes being cut. Imagine something between this, and {Hot Fuzz}, my go-to example of uncomfortably fast comedy editing. I laughed out loud, especially at some of the physical jokes, and so the whole thing would be better if those moments were compressed closer together. I prefer the original, which is more bizarre and memorable, but I'm glad this exists.",
