	"review": "This kind of storytelling is a long way from the elevated horror we enjoy these days. It makes me glad we now live in an era of high-budget TV dramas that can look almost as good as movies. This has real old fashioned television acting, blocking for 4:3 screens, and horrid sound quality. The first two segments are far from terrifying, more like dramas with macarbre twists at the end. All three featured <i>dun dun daaah</i> musical stings at the key moments too, which left me re-evaluating my Halloween viewing decisions.",
