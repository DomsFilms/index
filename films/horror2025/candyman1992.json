	"review": "I think a better ending would have been if she followed the sound of the baby into the pyre, only to find it was a trap and Candyman was waiting for her there, baby nowhere to be seen. They would burn together and you'd hear her scream during a wide shot of the flames, and the camera would tilt up to the sky and fade out. There would be no funeral or mirror scene, and it would have ended with a montage of kids spreading the tale of the Candyman and the woman.",
	"spoilers": "With the real ending, I find it strange to imagine the Candyman had to patiently look after that baby for a month while Helen was sedated.",
