	"review": "Now this is entertainment! Made by eschewing genuine scares in favour of short bursts of strong and wacky characters; the exaggerated performances never have time to wear out their welcome. The transitions between segments are great, and the occasional comic book close-ups against illustrated backgrounds look great. It reminds me of this kids show I used to watch called {ZZZap!} The high score here is a result of achieving its modest goals handily, and being so fun to watch, rather than from any kind of sophisticated filmmaking. My system has always been to rate how much I enjoy films on each specific occasion, rather than an analysis of their quality. The grotesque score is also earned by the variation of imagery on display. Nothing is individually too horrible to look at, but there's a buffet of brutality to see, coving bugs, monsters, the undead and violent cruelty.",
