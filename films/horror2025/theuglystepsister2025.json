	"review": "Like a Tim Burton gothic melodrama, except for adults, and with some actual body horror chops. Most characters are quite detached from reality, except for Alma. It's like Cinderella from the perspective of an ugly stepsister who goes through various body horror tribulations prior to attending the ball. It was an interesting choice to make Cinderella sexually liberated in the face of the prince's virginal expectations. I interpreted it as part of the film's message that you don't have to conform to traditions and standards to be considered beautiful. Courage, happiness and freedom can manifest beauty in a less superficial way. The soundtrack is not at all what you'd expect from this twisted fantasy setting.",
