	"review": "It's not really horror, but a monster themed superhero movie. I thought it similar in tone to the Sam Raimi {Spiderman} movies of the same era, but definitely not as good. The script is packed full of hammy lines and unearned emotional beats, and I found Hellboy himself to unlikeably curt. If you're 11 he will seem very cool. The plot muddles along haphazardly: Nazi Rasputin gets sucked into space but is summoned back, and his plan is to unleash a beast that wants to fight Hellboy, while George Bluth is in charge of telling Hellboy fight it back. This leads to them fighting in various locations, and these were the weakest parts for me. I simply don't get any enjoyment from CGI fist fighting/wrestling scenes, and it's one of the main reasons I try to stay away from superheroes. Hellboy himself and some of the other monster costumes are fun, but the beast is CGI, and you have to see it get pummeled over and over. The Polaroid photo taxi scene made me laugh because of how stupid it seemed and how awkwardly it fits in immediately after one of those fight scenes.",
