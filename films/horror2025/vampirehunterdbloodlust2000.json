	"review": "I find it hard to imagine how this is an adaptation of a novel, the third book in a series of 56 main entries so far. To me it appeared to be a series of loosely tossed together action set pieces and suave one-liners. Aloof mercenaries bouncing between chase and battle sequences, giving me no reason to care about any of them. I watched with the English dub, which was probably a mistake because it wasn't so hot. I don't think this is inherently a bad way to watch anime, because it's all <i>dubbed</i>, but if they didn't take the western release seriously enough then it can result in some bad translations or stilted line reads. It's especially true of the older stuff. The animation itself is worth praising here, especially those fluttering vampire cloaks.",
