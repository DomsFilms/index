	"review": "Imagine you are watching {E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial}, but the alien is a psycho goreman. That's what it's like to watch {PG: Psycho Goreman}. It's a comedy that sends up 80s sci-fi, costumed warrior fantasies, space operas, and the parents of children who go on these filmic adventures. I really liked it but it's not perfectly crafted like a masterpiece deserving of a 10. The human characters live in a realistic looking neighbourhood, wear normal clothes and sustain normal injuries. The alien characters live in surreal sets, wear absurd costumes and are torn apart with cheesy practical effects. It really did make me laugh, as well as wince at the occasional realistic body horror shots. The goreman himself looks like a merman out of {Castlevania}, and somehow he's the least crazy-looking non-human character in the movie. Think {Nekrogoblikon}, {Gwar} or {Henge}. The star is this child actor who has to shout and scream and behave like Louise Belcher for the whole movie, and as long as you can enjoy that character in the first few minutes, you'll probably love the rest of it. I can see how it might put some people off, but I don't think the movie would work without her. The movie needs a fiercer psycho, to keep the goreman under control.",
