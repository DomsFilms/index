	"review": "This early attempt by the director of {Franky Freako} and {PG: Psycho Goreman} has a much lower budget, and is just a bit dull in comparison. There are moments that were laugh-out-loud funny, but it's too visually and narratively monotonous to hold your attention effectively. Manborg's personality left a lot to be desired too. Ultimately, there are so many other silly fun horror comedies to watch, I can't recommend this one. Watch {Freaked} instead.",
