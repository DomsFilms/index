	"review": "One of the big flaws of Frictional Games' {Amnesia} series is that while the monsters are very scary at first, they stop being scary after the first time they catch you. This is also true here, but it doesn't matter because the real horror in this game comes from the sci-fi concepts it tackles. The idea that you are just a photograph of a dead man, or maybe a machine with a purpose, or maybe nothing is real. The idea that the only thing you can trust is your perception of the present, as your memories could be from any number of previous iterations. But what if your senses are just hallucinations anyway? We're hanging on to this life by a thread, and could lose it all as individuals, or as a species, in a single unfortunate moment. In terms of suspense and shock, I find video games much scarier than films. The suspense lasts as long as you let it, if you are shirking from making progress. However, I find them to be less grotesque than films. Even though this game shows you an abundance of horrible things, because they are inherently CGI, and they are not animated to level of fidelity matching practical VFX, they do not evoke the same response.",
