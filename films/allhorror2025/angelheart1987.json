	"review": "I think it's a bit derivative of your typical noir detective drama, slow and talky. It's quite a narrow genre really. The horror elements that slowly creep in, before becoming all-consuming at the end, are what sets it apart. There is an amazing scene towards the end in terms of choreography and lighting; you'll probably know which one I'm referring to because it's the most memorable non-chicken moment. Some of the minor characters have very wooden performances, and while I understand that Mickey Rourke is doing the typical noir shtick, it doesn't excuse his negative charisma. Sam Spade is an example of the same character with a lot more charm. It's easy to compare this to {Jacob's Ladder}, a better movie released three years later, but that's not to say this one is bad. It has just been surpassed.",
