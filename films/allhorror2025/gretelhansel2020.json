	"review": "There is a very strange mix of accents in this. I liked the idea and the visual design, but I'm not so sure about the casting or soundtrack. I described it as \"netflixy\" but I can't really explain why I feel that way. Maybe it was just kind of low budget, but filmed with modern high quality digital cameras used primarily for TV. Maybe it's because the soundtrack was synthy and reminded me of {Stranger Things} more than any folk horror movie score. It has some very jarring shifts in colour between the interior and exterior of the gingerbread house, and that's not a criticism, just something that I think will be more memorable than the plot or characterisation over time.",
