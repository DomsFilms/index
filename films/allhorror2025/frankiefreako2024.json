	"review": "The world's most fastidious and unadventurous person gets sucked into an 80s chaotic puppet movie akin to {Gremlins} or {The Garbage Pail Kids}. I suppose these appealed to kids in the same way {Minions} do now. Kids love a crowd of little mischief-making guys. But this one is a horror comedy for nostalgic adults and it's really enjoyable. It is presented with a real aesthetic and VHS-looking colours, but still looks sharp and is widescreen. Real commitment to the bit would have involved analogue noise and a 4:3 aspect ratio. It's like that one movie you saw as a kid and don't remember the title, and now you aren't sure if it was real or a dream.",
