	"review": "Ultimately this series wasn't as good as I hoped, as has always been the case with the {Alien} franchise since its perfect start. The show is keen to ask philosophical questions about the typical consciousness copying sci-fi conundrum, but it didn't really push the concept in any new or interesting way. It also completely disregarded it when it was time for some horror: sections which were always based on rampaging monsters, and never leant on psychological suspense, never blending into those other themes. If you separated all the monster parts from the synth parts, you could have two self-contained shows. Maybe the producers were worried they couldn't pull off a more focussed horror-only or existential-only series, but I'm not so sure. My favourite episode was the flashback on the ship, which omitted the hybrid children completely, and there's no end of powerful sci-fi films that explore similar themes without any real action or horror, like {Ex Machina} or {Blade Runner}. It would have taken some bravery to make this series a completely brutal body horror kill-fest just for us sickos, but I think I would have liked it more if it was. The cliffhanger at the end of each episode could be a new parasitic infection, or a new quarantine escapee. The sets, lighting and CGI really shone when the blood was splattering. After taking a look at user scores on IMDB, it looks like that pure horror episode was the most popular, so maybe they'll tune the formula in a positive way for he next season.",
