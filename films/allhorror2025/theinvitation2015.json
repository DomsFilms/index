	"review": "I watched this with friends and it seemed like we could all predict what was going to happen, but the plot moves so slowly that it was frustrating to see it all play out long after the surprises were over. It's a nice little idea for a short film or anthology segment, stretched into a movie that fails mainly because its pacing. Any questions we had afterwards, about missing information or potential plot holes, stung even harder knowing that it wasted so much time explaining what we already knew. Like {Funny Games} there are awkward explanations about why phones aren't available, but that just invites you to think about other possible escape plans. It's a shame, because some of the performances were good, including the leading man who did a lot with so few lines. He was very effective with his silent emotion, confusion and suspicion. I can't recommend it. Watch {Coherence} instead.",
