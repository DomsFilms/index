	"review": "I expected this to be a typical legacy sequel, wheeling in the old cast for cameos, and going through the motions of referencing all the memorable parts from the original. It is, but I enjoyed it far more than other films that fit that description. Maybe it's because I've only seen {Beetlejuice} once and I'm not tired of it. Willem Dafoe and Monica Bellucci are barely in this, so each time they popped up I was mildly surprised, after repeatedly forgetting about their characters. There were so many plot lines that it had to move really fast, and I found it totally hooked me in with that pacing.",
