	"review": "I liked this at first because it starts off as a fun family Christmas movie, with the unpleasant twist of the nightmare cousins coming to stay. At that point it could have become a generic comedy where crazy uncle Will Ferrell comes to stay, but instead it becomes a generic monster horror where crazy ancient god Krampus visits instead. What I didn't like, was how it felt a bit like it was designed by committee, with a mishmash of ideas and tropes rather than one clear and cohesive vision. It had cool puppets and costumes, but it also had cheesy and unnecessary CGI. If this was made in the 90s and was a little more whimsical and less self-serious, it might have been considered a classic by now. But I'm sure this isn't going to enter the nostalgic Christmas classic rotation any time soon.",
	"spoilers": "I liked the CGI flashback, although it didn't really add anything or fit in with the rest of the plot very well. I did not like the CGI gingerbread men. The individual parts of this movie just didn't fit together very well at all.",
