    "review": "If you are one of my colleagues or a member of my family, don't watch this movie. It's very much for a certain type of person, and I'm worried you'll judge me because of how much I liked it. It's a quirky erotic horror comedy that feels like a fever dream. It's filled with bizarre characters and there's no straight man to call them out for the way they act, so you just have to go along with whatever is happening without questioning it, like a dream. It's a little grotesque in a violent way, but very much more so in a greasy way. I love it for its originality and commitment to the bit. If you like the sense of humour in {Napoleon Dynamite} and {Garth Marenghi's Darkplace} and are a certified sicko, then this is for you. I have friends that match that description, and they know who they are.",
