Like any anthology, you inevitably end up with a favourite and least favourite part. Then, it's easy to think about what you would change: removing the worst part entirely. In a film with a more cohesive plot, it's not as easy to identify something like that, because it won't be as <i>modular</i>. The vignettes are broken up in this film, so you see the start of each story, and then the end of each one. Compared to something like {V/H/S} this meant that my opinions on each weren't fully formed until the end, and I had to remember what was going on, rather than moving on mentally during the transitions. Ultimately the crawling woman segment didn't do it for me; I was intrigued at first but it didn't go anywhere interesting. As a whole, it's an exploration into some truly bizarre forms of body horror, that didn't really deliver a message or tell a compelling story, but I'm glad it made the journey from someone's filthy mind onto the screen.",
