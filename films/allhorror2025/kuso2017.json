Like any anthology, you inevitably end up with a most and least favourite part. Then, it's easy to think about what you would change: removing the worst part entirely. In a film with a more cohesive plot, it's not as easy to identify what you would have changed. The vignettes are broken up in this film, so you see the start of each story, and then the end of each one. Compared to something like {V/H/S} this meant that my opinions on each weren't fully formed until the end, and I had to remember what was going on, rather than moving on mentally. It's an exploration into some bizarre forms of body horror, that didn't really deliver a message or tell a compelling story, but I'm glad it made the transition from someone's filthy mind onto the screen.",
