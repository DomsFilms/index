	"review": "This is your standard abandoned asylum exploration horror. It uses some cheap but effective tricks like slowly peeking around dark corners with handheld cameras, and I can't deny it's effective at building suspense. But at the end there's a bunch of generic scares and a very casual nod towards an occult backstory that doesn't fit in with the rest of the plot in any way. I don't hate it, but it doesn't do anything I haven't seen before. Watch {The Blair Witch Project} or {Incantation} instead.",
