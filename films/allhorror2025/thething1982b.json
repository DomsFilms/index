	"review": "How did Blair dig a cave and build a space ship chassis so fast? There are a few parts that make no sense to me. I can't be convinced this isn't a masterpiece though. It is the perfect blend of 80s cheese and machismo, body horror and practical effects, cryptic sci-fi and psychological tension. Might it be a better movie if you don't see a flying saucer heading towards earth in the intro? Maybe I would like it more if you cut the saucer out and just had the camera panning towards earth. It would hint at the theme of space travel, and make you consider the planet as a destination rather than an origin point for the Thing. Then you would discover what's beneath the ice at the same time as the characters. I can watch it so many times and never get tired of it, but I might start to run out of interesting things to write about...",
