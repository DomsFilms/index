	"review": "Kind of like {Coherence} and {Primer}, it's an interesting concept but maybe not executed as well or as memorably as either of those two other films. I found it a bit annoying how it asked so many questions that it never intended to answer, and how it even laughed at its own plot holes sometimes. I thought the dialogue writing was great, with some real set-piece conversation scenes, but the performances didn't quite do them justice. There were also some very long musical montages which seemed to waste a lot of time, with one ending in a winking way, where a character gets sick of listening to the music and stops it abruptly.",
	"spoilers": "The best oart fir ne was when they were trapped indefinitely waiting for the visitor, unable to leave and with no idea how long it would be. It's a psychologically scary situation, like being in prison not knowing if you'll die there, or if the masters of time will somehow force you to live for eternity, or if the most terrifying visitor has already shown up and is creeping behind you. They didn't even know if the visitor would be human, or if it would be an unfathomable horror. I was disappointed when it turned out to just be some random person with a gun.",
