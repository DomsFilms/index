	"review": "A very joke-dense spoof that doesn't feel at all like a horror movie. In theory it's a body horror but the freek transformations were so absurd I'm not sure if it really counts. It gets a higher grotesque rating because there are some fun effects, rather than realistic, horrible, or scary effects. It starts with an amazing animated title sequence, followed by a winking televised interview scene that allows them to frame the rest of the plot as a flashback, and yada-yada their way through any gaps or nonsensical parts. It eventually becomes a relatively wholesome farce about a ragtag band of freak show performers, most of whom deviate from the body horror formula and amount to silly costumes for visual gags. When everything I liked about the film was a bite-sized joke, it's hard to write anything about it without spoiling them and chipping away at the enjoyment of anyone who takes my recommendation. If you like {Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure}, and a bit of horror comedy, then you should definitely watch this (and probably {Frankenhooker}).",
