	"review": "I think this starts off as a 10/10 drama about blues musicians, but then it shifts suddenly into something else. I like that they took a big swing with the genre switch, but it doesn't keep up that perfect rating after it happens. Maybe the drama was elevated by the promise of something else coming, and I wouldn't have liked it as much if it finished like it started? I'm not sure about this. The second half uses a lot of tropes in a short space of time and I wasn't quite as impressed with that, but I still loved it.",
	"spoilers": "The music scenes were amazing, particularly when the preacher boy starts sings in the car for the first time, when he connects with the fire spirits of the past and future, and when the vampires do their irish dancing number. I didn't want to include this in my vampire marathon, because I didn't know it would specifically pivot into a vampire movie, and I don't want anyone else to know that in advance either.",
