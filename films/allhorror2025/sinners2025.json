I like that they took a big swing with the genre switch, but it doesn't keep up that perfect score to after it happens. Maybe the drama was elevated by the promise of something else coming, and I wouldn't have liked it as much if it finished like it started? I'm not sure about this. The second half uses a lot of tropes in a short space of time and I wasn't quite as impressed with that, but I still loved it.",
