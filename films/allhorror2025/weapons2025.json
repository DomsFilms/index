	"review": "2025 has been an insane year for horror so far, and I haven't even seen the big franchise editions like {V/H/S} or {Final Destination} yet. {Nosferatu} hit UK cinemas on January 1st, then we had {Sinners}, {28 Year Later}, {Bring Her Back}, and now one of the most entertaining and captivating horror thrillers I've seen. It's like {Barbarian} in its mix of thriller and comedy, with absurd horror twists. It also has the same non-linear storytelling to cut between perspectives and timelines, creating TV-like cliff-hanger endings to end each act. There are some great characters here, although Josh Brolin is perhaps the least animated and most predictable of them. I suppose that's what you cast Brolin for; he is the straight man to the otherwise mildly comedic performances. Zach Cregger you've done it again! Add this guy to the growing list of exciting new horror Filmmakers, where every film is a guaranteed watch: Damian McCarthy, Jordan Peele, Panos Cosmatos, Ari Aster, Steven Kostanski, Robert Eggers, Julia Ducournau, Rose Glass. What an exciting time to be into this stuff.",
	"spoilers": "I love projectile vomiting scenes. My fascination with them probably started with {Little Britain}, and I've never grown bored of that same effect. It's best when their mouth is wide open, the stream is wide but focussed, and the pressure is high. Bonus points if it sprays directly into someone else's face.",
