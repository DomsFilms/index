	"review": "This really held up on my second viewing, I think partly because of how incredibly beautiful it is, and partly because of the music. Musicals are inherently re watchable, more so than mystery or thriller movies. I was crazy not to give this a 10 the first time around, thinking the second half wasn't as good as the first; all the best songs are in the second half, and while it starts off as an incredibly gripping drama, it gets more fun towards the end. Really my only issue is that the final action scene might be unnecessary, but I'm not sure how else it could have ended. Unless P.T.A and Leo can blow me away with {One Battle After Another}, this is likely to be my favourite film of the year, closely followed by {Weapons}.",
