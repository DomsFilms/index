	"review": "It's very grotesque, with a mix of realistic injuries that are hard to watch, and supernatural body horror that is fun and silly. It's also suspenseful, but not in a very sophisticated plot-driven way; you are anxiously waiting to see what horrible things will happen next, rather than wondering about how it will end. There were also a few plot threads that went nowhere. Why would she need the father's hair? Why is there a focus on the cat at first? Ollie is gross but he exists as a demonic vessel for body horror effects unrelated to the wider plot. The characterful house in the woods reminded me of {Hereditary}. Everyone hates seeing gaslighting happen in movies like this, and seeing other characters ignore the truth at the peril of the protagonist. It's almost too easy as a narrative technique.",
