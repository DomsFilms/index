	"review": "I saw it in the cinema in surprisingly decent quality. I previously gave this an 8, but I enjoyed it more this time, and think it deserves better. I like how they mention all the junk food brands they have to survive on, once they run out of fresh food. Christopher Eccleston is great in this. He shows up at just the right time, when you are starting to realise the film won't really be about vast hoards of zombies, but about the dangers of a nihilistic society where everyone feels threatened and nobody faces consequences for their actions. That one song on the original soundtrack, that you hear at the climax of the film, is fantastic.",
