I think whoever said that was referring to the way this first film doesn't have any kind of plot or protagonists, but in the end I really didn't like the plot of {Terrifier 2} or {Terrifier 3}, and so from my perspective there was no reason to skip this. It's thankfully free of heroes or call-backs to previous nonsense. It feels a bit like three short stories mashed together. Characters come in and out (mostly murdered) at unexpected times. Someone is sawn in half with amazing speed and ease. I thought it was odd that we see some of Art's skin beneath his costume, as I can't recall that happening later in the series, and so I had been thinking of him as a supernatural entity rather than a human in a costume. They really nailed his behaviour in that pizzeria scene. I like him as a character, and I like that these films exist, but they are just not very good.",
