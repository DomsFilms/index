	"review": "There's a lot of British lore in this: Teletubbies, the Angel of the North, and the Sycamore Gap Tree. Once again it's more about what happens when society suddenly stops functioning, than it is about zombies. Having said that, it has some juicy conceptual horror about how (non-supernatural) zombies continue to survive after infection. It would have looked better if it were shot on film, but the filmography is so imaginative that it doesn't matter. Ralph Fiennes and Jody Comer are great in it. In general I loved the writing, but I thought the scene with Erik was a bit on the nose. My second favourite film of the year so far, after {Sinners}. Bring on {Eddington} and {One Battle After Another}!",
