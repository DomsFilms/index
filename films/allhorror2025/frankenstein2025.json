	"review": "It looks more like a TV show to me rather than a movie. For an amateur critic it's hard to explain why, but my guess is flat lighting, a lack of cinematic wide shots, and the faster pacing with constant dialogue and narration. There's a lack of cinematic moments with a camera sweeping over the mountains to a cinematic score. The lead roles are realised very well. I do wish it hit me a bit harder emotionally.",
