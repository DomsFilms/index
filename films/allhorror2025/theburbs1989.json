	"review": "There's a cool cast here but they're slightly wasted with poor direction, and a story that doesn't go anywhere interesting. These characters each deserve more time to shine, and more development throughout the plot. Visually it's not very memorable or exciting, but there are some good visual/physical gags. I also enjoyed some of the one-liners. The ideal comedy horror movie is ambitious and inventive in both genres, but this is merely a competent comedy fused with a very generic and forgettable horror. It's about that suburban house in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3!",
