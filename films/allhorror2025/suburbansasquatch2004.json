	"review": "Shockingly bad, maybe a bit racially and culturally insensitive, and it would be totally boring if I didn't find it so funny. I can't believe the sound effects, especially the sasquatch's roar. The very first scene shows you everything they are capable of, and nothing else of note happens afterwards. It's just the same kind of scene repeated in different locations until the end. The exposition parts are so full of filler, because the story is so simple. Characters repeatedly state their intentions with slightly different wording, as though they were given notes only, and not an explicit script, but asked to keep talking for a set amount of time for each scene. I think it's more fun to watch than {Birdemic: Shock and Terror}, but it isn't any better than it in terms of quality.",
