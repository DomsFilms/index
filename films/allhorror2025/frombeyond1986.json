	"review": "Very similar to {Re-Animator}, with the same director and leading role. It's fun, uncomfortably sexual, gory, and proving to quite memorable despite being one of seven films I watched over the weekend. Unfortunately I thought the character Bubba Brownlee, who would never have such a name outside of something like {South Park} these days, was a real weak link in the trio. He didn't have much of a personality, didn't know what he was doing the whole time, and his performance was wooden. He was like an unironic Dean Learner. It's very gory, but it's not exactly the best use of practical gore effects I've seen. More of a quantity over quality grotesque display.",
