There isn't really enough substance here to keep you engaged once you understand what the premise is. I like how brightly lit it is, and how clean and well dressed the villains are. They remind me of the white outfit of the Bing-searching psycho in {Get Out}. I really do like the concept, but the change it most needed was another pass of the script to improve the dialogue, as some parts of it were really clunky. For example, we have to watch the characters faff around with a mobile phone, having to believe they don't know enough about how it works to fetch help, even though it powers on and displays enough signal? They couldn't send a text message? They couldn't repeatedly call 911 without saying anything, to prompt a police visit? They unnaturally jam in lines about why the charger is unavailable, and why there isn't a landline. It's all been done better, at least since 2007.",
