It was barely a horror, as the capability of the evil robots was demonstrated near the start, and nothing unexpected or increasingly intense happened afterwards. There was nothing to be scared of, so it was essentially a slasher in the most basic sense. The robots were kind of cool props, but they deserved to be in something much better. There was very little fun to be had watching this. I did like the one exploding head moment, and I suspect they used a really crappy looking head, because they showed it so briefly. While watching, I wrote a note that I hated the soundtrack, but it's so forgettable that while writing this review, I can't even remember why.",
