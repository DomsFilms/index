	"review": "It's an amazing achievement that this entire movie is one tracking shot. There are car rides, moped chases, shootouts, nudity, characters getting drenched in blood, and the camera follows it all very well. I still think nothing can beat the {Boogie Nights} opening shot where the camera starts on a crane and seamlessly moves down to a walking steadicam operator, but that requires a higher budget and it doesn't last for the entire film. Here they director claims they had 5 days, with an opportunity for one take per day as the film takes place while the sun sets, over a 10km stretch of a French town. They used the final take for the movie and it really does work well. Some of the writing isn't great, and I didn't particularly know what was going on until the very end, but I had a good time watching it. I found it funny how many speaking electronic devices there were: the burglar alarm, elevator, and car all had robotic voices telling us their status out loud in a way you would never want as a consumer. The Combine-looking guys had me thinking that if there was ever a Half Life movie, it should be in one take like this, or maybe even in first person like a more tasteful {Hardcore Henry}.",
