	"review": "Very funny and cheesy, but also clearly self-aware. It's not as appealing as an accidentally funny horror movie. The humour is a bit like {Wet Hot American Summer}, or {Garth Marenghi's Darkplace} but without the smarmy self-referential aspect. It loses a bit of momentum towards the end, when the corrupt mayor plot doesn't really go anywhere, and the last scene in particular is totally predictable.",
