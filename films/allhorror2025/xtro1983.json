	"review": "This uses its lower budget well, especially for the effects. Unfortunately the story is not very gripping and lots of the film seemed like filler. There's a gratuitous scary clown, and all sorts of costumes and kills that aren't thematically related to the story. The downstairs neighbour character is played for comedy, while the parents are all deadly serious. The line: \"he's not responsible enough to look after animals\", just after she pulverises the boy's pet, made me laugh. Every member of the family have different regional British accents.",
