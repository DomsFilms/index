	"review": "Like {Oddity} it has such a brilliant feeling of dread, with a situation that will obviously devolve into horror and violence, and characters that would definitely just run away at the very start if they only knew they were in a horror film. It reminded me of {Possum} too, with the decaying house, and the air thick with the memory of past traumas that we learn about throughout the film. I'm adding Damian Mc Carthy to my list of horror directors to follow, and I'll watch whatever he makes next without needing any convincing or watching any trailers.",
