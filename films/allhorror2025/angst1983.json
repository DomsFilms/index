	"review": "The sweaty, desperate, lonely efforts of a serial killer. This uses a lot of shots where the camera is attached to his body, like you're watching Sir Digby Chicken Caesar run around. Everything he does is laboured and improvised, and it has big David Lynch energy. It reminded me of scenes from other films where the killer scrappily chokes the life out of their victims and tries to hide the body, powered by adrenaline, except in this case the sequence lasts for the entire film. I liked it, but it's definitely just one for the sickos. Watch it if you liked the parts of {The Vanishing}/{Spoorloos} that follow the killer's process.",
