    "review": "Because this is the first episode back after being cancelled, and the first feature-length one, it's like a celebration of Futurama full of cameos from past characters and meta jokes about the show. The plot isn't as good as your typical movie, and so it does just feel like a 90 minute episode instead. One thing I didn't like was the long scene in the middle where Bender only talks to himself. He's not nearly as funny when he's not bouncing off of other characters. One side character I don't like is Robot Santa Claus. His voice is so monotonous and he only has one joke. It's solid, but not this show at its best.",
