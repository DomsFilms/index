    "review": "This came out in the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey so it's interesting to compare. They both had big budgets but 2001s was higher. 2001 still looks amazing and this film looks dated. The music is good but it's of it's time. The lighting, sets, makeup etc. look like they're from an old film. This is a classic, but it's not as timeless as 2001, and it doesn't predict or depict space travel as accurately. The script is a little heavy-handled but it's messages are still relevant. Kudos to them for having a serious black astronaut in the 60s. It made me laugh when Taylor smokes a cigar in his spaceship.",
