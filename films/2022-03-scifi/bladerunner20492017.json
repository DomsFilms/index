    "review": "A slow, ponderous journey that does a good job of keeping the tone of the original. Like before, it asks a lot of questions and doesn't give any clear answers. Some of the action bits seem unnecessary. In general I was very relieved that they hadn't messed this up, and never expected it to surpass the original.",
