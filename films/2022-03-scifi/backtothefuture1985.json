    "review": "When you watch this an adult, you'll find that this is not actually very good. It has no subtlety and a lot of the dialogue is so tedious and slow. Some characters basically look directly at the camera while explaining the easy-to-grasp concepts. It's fun but definitely a children's film, with a little bit of swearing and innuendo. The scene where Marty meets his incredibly thirsty mother did make me laugh. The Libyans are embarrassingly racist and low budget. They used two American guys in cheap costumes who can't speak Arabic. How did they think that scene was good enough to use in the movie?",
