    "review": "I loved this. I liked it's style of humour, and the characters are all so wacky and memorable. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the most unsettling version of Ace Ventura. Ojka looked very good and the mountain scenery was nice. I liked the soundtrack too. It reminded me of the Playstation game Abe's Oddysee, which is also an dark humour anti-corporation story about meat.",
