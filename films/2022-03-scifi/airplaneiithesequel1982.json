    "review": "This isn't as good as the first one, but I like it. It has such similar jokes to the first that you couldn't watch and enjoy this if you'd seen it, or the first one, recently enough to remember any of them. Luckily I haven't seen either in a long time, and the first film isn't a sci-fi like this one clearly is. It loses Nielsen but gains Shatner: an equal trade in terms of comedy here. It does feel like some of the jokes were unused material deemed not good enough for the first film. They just don't make them like this any more... Probably because of how it constantly makes light of sexual assault and terrorism.",
