    "review": "Wow. This is much worse than I remember from my childhood. Terrible dialogue and acting. I kind of like the soundtrack, but they use the same song too much, and there was nothing else I can praise it for. So much time is used for gimmicky scenes like chatting with Max and flying around. The jokes are terrible and Max is insufferable after the brain scan. Definitely a poor man's E.T. or a family friendly episode of Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. The lead actor went on to be convicted for bank robbery.",
