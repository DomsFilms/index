	"review": "Until <i>the mess</i> this is deeply unpleasant to watch, because it's just one cringeworthy social faux pas after another, and they're all fairly realistic so you can react genuinely to them. Afterwards it takes a turn into absurdity, where the awkward and shocking moments are unrealistic and therefore funny. It becomes really enjoyable and I was strongly considering giving it a 10 by the end. But it didn't ask any questions that I'll think about for days, or contain any mysteries that inspire me to rewatch it for clues, and I won't be driving around listening to the score. If any one of those were true it would get my perfect rating.",
