It's a nice idea and it's technically impressive, but it feels so incredibly long and slow with a constant level of intensity rather than any kind of build-up. I could only endure the story rather than get swept up by it, and that was a disappointment because I wanted to like it so much more. Once again, erotic horror has failed to click with me.",
