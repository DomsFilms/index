	"review": "I found it hard to understand some of the Texan farmer accents in this. I felt like the whole film was building up to a big beast reveal, but it petered out a little instead. Some of the minor characters were my favourites, and the male lead was the least interesting. They were all so insistent on believing their hallucinations; a bit more self awareness would have helped.",
