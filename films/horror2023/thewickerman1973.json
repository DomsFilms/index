    "review": "I liked it but I don't regard it as some masterpiece. The concept is great and the whole film is a well executed exercise in having curiosity slowly turn to dread. But the ending was unsatisfying, quick, and handwavy. I wanted to know more about the importance of the sacrifice being a fool. When the policeman threatened Christopher Lee with being next year's sacrifice I thought that was cool and wanted more drama out of it, but the remark is mostly ignored.",
