    "review": "This is like a fake movie that would be on in the background of a modern horror comedy, like <i>Cheddar Goblin</i>. The version I watched had warbling VHS sound and lots of scratches, which added to the old and creepy aesthetic. It has laughable early digital effects and insane practical effects, including some martial arts scenes. I enjoyed it and consider it to be like slightly more sincere and sane equivalent of <i>Hausu</i>.",
