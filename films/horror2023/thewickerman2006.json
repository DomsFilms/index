    "review": "A rare miss for my boy Nic Cage here. The direction is terrible, resulting in some cheesy lines being emphasised weirdly, and some decent lines being ruined completely. There are extra small twists added randomly over the original, like the way the women are in charge, the bees (not the bees!), and Cage being Rowan's father. These don't add anything of value to the story, and don't make it seem like there are enough good new ideas to justify a remake. I would guess that somebody was instructed to add some new elements to the screenplay without touching the general story at all, by some script editor: an unenviable task. Nic is more of a fool than the policeman in the original, and the lines I liked about the fool and next year's sacrifice were removed, making the ending even more incongruous. I saw the version with the leg breaking and bee face scene that was cut from the theatrical release. Cage also kicks someone into a bookshelf like a martial arts film for some reason. There is some really cheesy sound editing in this, with exaggerated stings when some new information is revealed. On the plus side the photography of the forest and village is pre pretty, and the excellent general story concept is preserved.",
