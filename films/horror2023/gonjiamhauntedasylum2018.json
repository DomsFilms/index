	"review": "This is a neat modern idea. Quite a lot of the film is taken up by seeing annoying youtubers doing their strange job, but when it kicks into another gear it gets scary and fun. There's no distinct theme and it's a bit of a horror trope buffet by the end, but it was scary. You have to have some unique ideas to make a good found footage horror film now, and this one has enough to make it worth a watch.",
