	"review": "This is a great idea for a sequel. It expands the mythology and adds detail and motivations that were missing in the first one. It has some neat ideas about how to stay fresh while keeping the Rec format. The priest was good and my favourite scene was when he talks to the tied up zombie. I enjoyed it much more than Rec, partly because it's less shouty and shaky. But it's not <i>not</i> shouty and shaky.",
