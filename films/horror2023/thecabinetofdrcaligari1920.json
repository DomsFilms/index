	"review": "If Nosferatu is more like a movie, this is more like a stage play. There are beautiful impressionistic theatre style sets, and the actors prance around in exaggerated ways. There are some bits that I assume were amazing and pioneering at the time: a fun cut where both scenes are visible simultaneously during the transition in opposite corners of the frame, and the text that appears dynamically over the scene where he's going crazy. Ultimately it's difficult for a film like this to hold your attention if you're used to modern storytelling. The title cards slow down the pace a lot, making it tedious at first and then confusing towards the end.",
