    "review": "This felt like a new idea to me, although I am not familiar with all the zoomer urban legends. Maybe some people will think this is just another Slenderman story. At first I thought I knew what it was about and what would happen, and then it warps half way through into something else, which left me wondering how much of the first half of the plot was real or staged. I had some interesting questions about it afterwards, that are kind of like plot holes, but not as annoying. The protagonist is almost annoyingly dour, but by the end you realise there is almost a diegetic reason for his one-dimensional performance too. He had funny pyjamas, like long johns.",
