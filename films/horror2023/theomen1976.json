    "review": "There's something about seeing a hanging body that never stops being creepy. That's the most disturbing part of this film, and the rest is all a bit more melodramatic and dated. I think it was a good idea to not give the child too many lines, as it keeps him sinister and stops the last scene where he looks down the camera lens from appearing silly. I thought it was a bit strange that they carried a five year old boy around so much, like a baby. Surely at his birthday party he wants to run around and play rather than being carried. Anyway, there's a funny decapitation in this film.",
