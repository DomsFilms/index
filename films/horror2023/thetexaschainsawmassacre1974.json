    "review": "This is from the same director as the Salem's Lot miniseries. The red wall in this movie is kind of like the red horn wall in the Marsten house, so maybe he liked it so much here he decided to impale someone on it later. This movie is very raw, and doesn't rely quite as much on grotesque visuals as you might expect. For example the family dinner scene spends a lot of time focussing on Sally's screaming face instead of the horrors she's seeing. I really liked the ending too. The only problem is that I don't think it will be very rewatchable for me.",
