    "review": "This is like a spoof of 1950s and 60s American B movies, with lots of good visual gags and all the character archetypes you'd expect. The plot is bare-bones but I stayed engaged because the jokes are evenly spread through the film, unlike some in this genre where it's all comedy in the first half and action in the second. There are fun lines and blobby effects from start to finish.",
