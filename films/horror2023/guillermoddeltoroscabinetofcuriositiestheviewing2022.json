	"review": "Introduces 6 interesting characters and disposes of them in less than an hour, in a masterful and entertaining way. The guests are a bit cheesy, almost like characters from Cluedo, and the hosts are so cool and serious by comparison. It gives you a sense that there are those in the know, and those who are about to find out. Considering the array of drugs in use, I'm surprised that this is the first time weed smoke came into contact with the artefact. I'm very excited for what Panos Cosmatos does next.",
