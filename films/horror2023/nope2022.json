	"review": "I think Get Out is the best of the Jordan Peele horror movies because it has a simple plot that you can get swept up in, and your immersion isn't broken by questions and confusion about the premise. In this film I spent too much time trying to figure out where the neighbour's tourist attraction was relative to the ranch, who lived where, how the alien enthusiasts got involved, let alone how the alien itself looked or worked. Get Out has a much tighter design, than this or Us, but all three are beautiful and entertaining. I think this might be the first time I've seen someone casually vaping in a movie. Despite it being a part of many people's lives, and despite the popularity of smoking on screen, it's a detail that is usually ignored. Kind of like how you never see a character go and take a shit outside of Pulp Fiction, or you never hear anyone mention how nice it is to have a long lie in outside of I'm Only Sleeping.",
