	"review": "With a huge budget and vapid storytelling, this is like the horror equivalent of a Star Wars or MCU film. Compare the introduction of the 6 characters here to the Cabinet of Curiosities episode: here there are 6 very similar personalities, all with trauma, who are introduced in such a slow and tedious way. They group up eventually and learn what's up, and then they split up for the day... At this point I knew that I would have to see each of them get spooked one after the other, but I didn't expect that segment to last almost an hour. An hour of each of the characters having a flashback to getting spooked as a child, then being spooked as an adult. It ends with a very long boss fight where they take turns to scream at some CGI and then save the day like superheroes. Instead of MCU quips and explosions it's quips and jump scares. I like Bill Hader but I didn't like how they used him here. On several occasions he would see a scary face pop out of the darkness, deliver a childish one liner, and then run away like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. They should really stop showing old-timey violent cartoons in psychiatric movie hospitals.",
