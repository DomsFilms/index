	"review": "The opening scene of this is just like high budget Garth Marenghi. I think it's intentionally schlocky, and it's entertaining but ultimately not that good. It does a nice trick of leaving you confused about a major plot detail, and revealing it later in an unexpected way. I didn't know the twist was coming at all and I thought I'd just not been paying attention, missing some vital information before that moment. There's a character in this who looks and acts so much like Fox Mulder than it can't be a coincidence. It has a strong Fincher vibe for the first half, but it devolves into a dull action movie at the end. I did enjoy watching it but it will probably merge with a load of other films in my memory by the next spooky season.",
