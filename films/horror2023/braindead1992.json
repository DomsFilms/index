	"review": "This should be as famous as {The Evil Dead}, and I like it much more. It's a comedy with real jokes, as well as comedic gore. It's so successful at what it attempts: it had me laughing, rooting for the protagonists, unsure of what would happen next, and easily earning a perfect grotesque rating. The main character is like Frank Spencer, and seeing him fight his overbearing zombified mother as they listened to {The Archers} was very funny.",
