    "review": "It's probably not for everyone but I love it. A totally imaginative and wacky collection full of jokes about horror tropes, comedic gore, and '99 nostalgia. Every part was highly entertaining and at least a little scary. The most intense story is at the end, unlike <i>V/H/S/94</i> which petered out a little. It's hard to choose a favourite part.#sI'd been saying how I wanted to see more horror movies about people going to hell, and especially wanted something as close as possible to a first person perspective of the transition between mortal life and eternal suffering. For example, <i>Drag Me to Hell</i> shows someone getting dragged, off-screen, to hell! But I wanted the camera to follow them so we could see where they got dragged to. I essentially cheered when the last segment of this anthology followed someone on their trip to a demon realm, and we got to see a very well realised alternate dimension of evil. More of this please!#d",
