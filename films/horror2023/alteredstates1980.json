	"review": "This is like a psychological horror/romance movie. The characters are more complex than what I'm used to in horror. The dialogue really sold the idea that they were academics talking among each other, and they didn't explain anything simple for the viewer's benefit. It gets a bit wacky by the end and I would have preferred it to be more realistic and psychological, rather than supernatural.",
