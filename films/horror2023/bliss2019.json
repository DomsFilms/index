If I was making this movie I would have picked something more extreme and original than a painting of a Castlevania boss, as the artwork that was driving her to insanity. It's not that crazy and you could easily come up with the idea to paint something like that without sacrificing yourself to cocaine and DMT. Maybe she should have made a sculpture of her own bodily fluids, or used the eyeballs of her victims for the eyes in the painting. If you like <i>Mandy</i> (the movie) and your expectations aren't too high, you may like this.",
