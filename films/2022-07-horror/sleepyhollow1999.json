    "review": "There's a lot of famous actors in this and it's a fun mainstream horror movie, very entertaining. The problem is that it has a huge specific flaw that really bothered me throughout: whenever the headless horseman shows up there are constant flashes of lightning. They use it so much, flashing multiple times per second, sometimes in every shot during dialogue. It's rarely accompanied by thunder sounds and it looks like it was done with a light on the set rather than edited in after filming. I watched this in a dark room on a big TV and I had to close my eyes to rest them towards the end as the light was so harsh and constant. The rest of the lighting is fine, so someone just got really carried away with that effect. I can't give a very good score if it made me want to close my eyes to avoid the pain of watching.",
