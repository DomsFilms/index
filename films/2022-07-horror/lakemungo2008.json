    "review": "Another documentary style film. This one keeps you on the hook, making you expect it to become creepy and supernatural, but the balance is maybe a little bit off. It's 80 minutes of build-up with one really ingenious scary moment near the end. I wish it got to the good stuff a little faster and had more ideas like that. This also had good music and sound. I watched it in a tent.",
