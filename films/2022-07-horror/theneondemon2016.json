    "review": "This film is about the fashion and modelling industry in L.A. It tries so hard to be stylish that it's almost annoying, but maybe that's to be expected from this industry. The dialogue was inane and all the characters were sociopaths, but maybe that's to be expected from this industry. It starts slowly and gets slower throughout, so it didn't hold my attention very well. It is beautiful and the soundtrack was great, but I wouldn't want to see it again. This is a very flattering comparison but in some ways it was almost like Mulholland Drive.",
