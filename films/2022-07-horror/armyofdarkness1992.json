    "review": "I was a little disappointed that this has almost completely dropped the horror angle and switched to total comedy, but I grew to like it as it went on. Still not as good as Evil Dead II, but a fun experience full of visual gags. I can't imagine wanting to see this again as there was no story to enjoy multiple times over, few characters and no drama. It's nothing if not for it's jokes. I can't really think of anything else to say about it, as there are really no notable features except for it's silliness that I wouldn't want to spoil, and has to be seen to be appreciated anyway.",
