    "review": "I found this very scary, and the level of suspense leading up to the ending is amazing. I watched the English dubbed version, which wasn't terrible but I wouldn't recommend it. Online some people have criticised this film for lacking original ideas, but I don't really agree with that opinion. I also don't mind that some shots are in the third person and ignore the found footage viewpoint. They helped show the characters faces more by not rigorously sticking to the handheld camera, and to mark the film down for that would be nitpicking. It really nails all types of horror, and it's simple story is made more interesting by the way it jumps abruptly between flashbacks. At one point the narrator tells you that you might not want to watch an upcoming scary part: a genius way or cranking up the suspense level.",
