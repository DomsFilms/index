    "review": "Just terrible, and yet this has good user reviews online and I found it in multiple lists of the scariest movies. I suspect that it's been promoted online by proud Turks, paid influencers, or maybe just people who haven't seen many modern western films and are happy to have something in the genre in their native language. Some of the jump scares are so amateurish, like screamer videos you might have seen on the internet in 2006. The camera shakes and someone screams into the microphone. There are many films in this series and I never want to see any more of them.",
