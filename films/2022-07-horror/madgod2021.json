    "review": "This is grotesque imagery - the movie and I really liked it. It's a dialogue-free animated film about a journey into a disturbing and weird place. You know when you've just overcome a challenge on the roof of a chapel? And then you realise you need to descend, back to the burg? And then you reach the more disturbing lower streets? And then you delve into the depths and can't imagine anything darker or danker? And then you realise you must descend further still? When you reach the fetid base you're convinced you've hit the bedrock layer, the bottom of the world. And yet you can keep going, and things down there start to get biblical. This film captures the same tone. They should show it at the Blighttown film festival.",
