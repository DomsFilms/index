    "review": "The actress who plays Mink was really good in this. She does a lot of creepy stuff, and the idea of being possessed and forced to destroy your own life through terrible acts is a scary one. The bit with the baby is especially scary. The scenery is really beautiful and the film is well made in general. Ultimately though, it is a little forgettable. There's a demon, people get spooked in the night, it's a mockumentary that falls apart as things get chaotic. I don't watch many Thai films so this was interesting enough, but I'd recommend The Wailing or Incantation over this.",
