    "review": "A businessman loses his mind after being bitten by a vampire. Is it a metaphor for drug addiction? How much of the character's experience only happened in his head, and was the vampire even real? Is this intentionally a comedy? Nic Cage's performance is too crazy in this film. All other parts of it are forgettable, compared with the way he chews the scenery. This film belongs in the same category as The Room, as it's easy to enjoy ironically, but is garbage when judged by any serious criteria.",
