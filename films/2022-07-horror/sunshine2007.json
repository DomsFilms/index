    "review": "I watched this on that day where it hit 40Â°C and it was very unpleasant. It starts as a very generic looking space mission thriller, and it gets more unique and intense about 40 minutes in. There's a really strange editing technique when they explore an abandoned ship, where things start to get interesting. This seems like exactly the kind of film I would know about and like, and yet I only learned of it this month. I'm glad I saw it.",
