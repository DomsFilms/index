    "review": "This was so much better than I expected; it deserves to be as famous as it is. The supernatural elements are downplayed, making it easy to imagine yourself in their dire situation. The performances are good, which is crucial as it's so lo-fi with no music and one intentionally unmemorable location for most of the film. Masterfully grim and dread-inducing, easily earning maximum points in that category. I was worried that it would be one of those films that has been copied so many times that it seems like it's full of tropes, but I had nothing to worry about.",
