    "review": "It seems like A24 are just in the business of distributing films that I like. Nobody has ever thought of running a company that only does good films until now, and it's really making my life easier when it comes to choosing what to watch. Going in to another A24 film knowing it was written and directed by Alex Garland, I knew I would have a good time. The themes in this film are a bit heavy-handed but apart from that it is fantastic. The acting and music/sound really stand out out. I love how they use the tunnel music later in the film. The ending is extremely striking: it doesn't explain much but it is unforgettable.",
