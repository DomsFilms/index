    "review": "The Western remake: a competently made film but it loses a lot of points for being totally unnecessary. It was released only two years after the original and is very similar, even using an almost identical set and with antagonists played by the same actors. The jump scares are more intense in this version, but not really any more enjoyable. The story isn't delivered in quite the same bold way as the original, making it easier to follow but even less memorable. There is unfortunately no reason to watch this, as the original is better is basically every way.",
