    "review": "Whoops this isn't a movie at all. It's a janky but endearing board game. It's like a lighter and more accessible tabletop RPG, where you work together to build a unique layout during the first half and then compete to win in the second half. It has a lot of ambiguous rules and wording, but that doesn't matter in the first half, and there's something likeable about it's lack of refinement. Issues usually emerge during the second half. Suddenly the vague rules matter a lot more as you compete with other players, and one player usually has to read a secret set of instructions without anyone else's help to interpret them. There are 50 different scenarios for the second half of the game, so you don't play the same scenario twice. I hear that the expansion, which adds more of everything, has 50 much weaker scenarios than the base game, so I've always shied away from buying it. Despite it's flaws it's still a personal favourite.",
