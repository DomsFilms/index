    "review": "The Japanese original: it is confusing at first but it grew on me as I figured out what was going on. There are some fun, silly jump scares and two monsters so you don't know which will break the tension. The plot isn't particularly gripping and acts more as an excuse for a series of individually spooky scenes to occur. I liked how the plot jumped around in time, once I got used to it, and I liked the small amount of music used. I don't think it will prove to be very memorable, despite watching two versions in quick succession.",
