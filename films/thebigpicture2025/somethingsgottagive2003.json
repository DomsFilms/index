This sort of film is always so brightly and flatly lit, and this is an extreme example of that, but at least it makes sense because they're in a $40 million beach house with a lot of natural light. I guess I like British rom-coms from the 90s, because I feel nostalgic about them and I understand the quirks of the middle class white people in them. But this is an american equivalent and I don't feel the same way. Is it normal to cut off someone's sweater like that? I just have no idea. One thing I did like was how incredibly early 00s it felt. They had low-waisted jeans, bucket hats, oval sunglasses, and Maroon 5. What a crazy time to be alive. Also I enjoyed seeing the old people use computers.",
