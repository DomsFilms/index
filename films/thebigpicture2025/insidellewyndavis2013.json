	"review": "Controversial choice, when they are only allowed one pick per director, and they went with this for the Coens. It is great, but it's also not as unique or memorable as {No Country for Old Men} or {A Serious Man} in my opinion. This film is so softly lit and desaturated that it looks like a dream sequence in another story. The plot is incidental and directionless, like the life of Llewyn. It's quite funny, and so Carey Mulligan's angry and sad performance really stands out from the other snide or silly characters. It shows the extent of their power, that I'm happy giving this an eight, even though I would personally pick five other Coen brothers films over this for the 21st century alone.",
