	"review": "Like {28 Days Later} or maybe {Brazil}, it's an anarchistic British apocalypse film depicting the fragility of our society and how quickly it could fall apart in difficult times. Is the cheesy authoritarian nationalist regime entirely a product of the infertility pandemic, or would we have sleepwalked into it regardless? The first act is almost too cheesy and melodramatic as they set the stakes and deliver exposition too fast, but this is required for the amazing road trip that follows, which doesn't need much dialogue and tells you everything you need to know through perfectly choreographed chaos. The amount of work that went into these long tracking shots must have been huge. Visually it has aged much better than 28 days later, but it did have ten times the budget. If you like {Black Mirror}, make sure you see this.",
