	"review": "Good evening, San Diego. (Tits McGee is on vacation.) I don't have much to say that they didn't bring up on the podcast: that this might not be the funniest film of the century so far, but it is probably be the best made and most memorable comedy; the most complete package. It's filmed and lit very nicely, the costumes and sets are good, the world is very well realised. 60% of the time, it works every time. I could recite 100 different funny lines from it, even though it's been a long time since my last watch. I think of it every time I read about pandas, panthers, or San Diego. My apartment smells of rich mahogany. It made Steve Carell famous, in his second news role after {Bruce Almighty}, before {The Office}. It was also Adam McKay's directorial debut. I'm not even mad, that's amazing. Apparently there are so many outtakes and unused scenes that you can find a feature-length spinoff film with the same characters online. There are no weak links, everyone is great in it, I love lamp. I'm in a glass case of emotion. Go fuck yourself, San Diego.",
