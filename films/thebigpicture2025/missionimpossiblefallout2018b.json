	"review": "Upon second watch, it's not as exciting. I guess it hasn't been long enough for me, so I knew what to expect and wasn't holding my breath about whether Tom would be able to save the world. I also paid more attention to the contrived evil plan, and the strange spy-world it's set it. Is the best way to travel from Berlin to Paris really to take a miltary cargo plane and jump out through an elecrical storm? How is the men's bathroom so clean and quiet during a giant gig? Why, if you needed a secret private spy meeting, would you choose to do it at the Palais de Chaillot? It's like, <i>really</i> busy there! Anyway, the point is that I still think this is a great film. It's just that my enjoyment watching it this time was diminished, and my rating system is of individual experiences, rather than an immutable review. And that bathroom fight scene is an all-timer.",
