	"review": "People say the opening scene is a standout moment, but I think the film is packed with scenes of equal quality. They are long, distinctly different, so memorable and so consistently great that it's hard to believe. The strudel, the basement, the baseball bat, the premiere, angry Hitler, that's a bingo! It's my favourite Tarantino film. I can't fault it in any way. Sometimes a pantomime, sometimes as intense as this medium can get. The heights Christoph Waltz reaches here can't be exaggerated. When I first saw this in the cinema, the film fell or burned off the reel somehow, just before the premiere scene started. They couldn't resume it, so we just had to leave, and were given coupons to watch another movie as compensation. Maybe I should have just used it to see it again, because I think it was a couple of years before I finally learned how it ended. If I recall, I used it to watch the remake of {The Taking of Pelham 123} on the same day.",
