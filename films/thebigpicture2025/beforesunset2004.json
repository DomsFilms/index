	"review": "The ending of {Before Sunrise} is so good, that a long term follow up to a romantic drama, fundamentally about a fleeting connection, shouldn't really work at all. Somehow, this extends the characters perfectly and gives you everything you want as a viewer. It even allows the characters to analyse the ending of their first movie in conversation, in a way that seems almost completely natural. The only parts I didn't buy into completely, were how they didn't really comment on the similarities between the time constraints of their meetings, and how they launched into conversation without as much emotion as I would expect, like neither of them were surprised to see each other. Jesse's hair is definitely a bit of a downgrade from his younger self, but he is depressed dad now, so maybe that makes sense. It's less casual and spontaneous than their first encounter, but that's what you should expect when you're older, and when you have more experience being emotionally honest and open. Two romantic hangout masterpieces in a row.",
