	"review": "It isn't one of my favourite Miyazaki films, but I still love it. The story feels so unconventional, as a westerner, that it's hard to follow or understand why any particular scene is thematically or narratively relevant. It's fun to learn about the mythology it references and the cultural context it lives within, but if I have to do that with almost every scene, then it can feel like hard work. Maybe an eight is harsh, and I acknowledge it looks incredible and was very important for their reputation in the west, but there are other Studio Ghibli films with characters I like more, stories I get more emotionally invested in, and with more memorable soundtracks. Some examples are the older {Porco Rosso}, and the newer {Ponyo}.",
