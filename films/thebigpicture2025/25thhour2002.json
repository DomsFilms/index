	"review": "A study of three men who are losing control of their lives in the wake of 9/11, which unavoidably permeates their lives in New York, without explicitly being the source of their woes. The first man is about to lose in a very real sense, with the clock ticking on his freedom. I particularly like how you see the stereotypical people he lashed out at earlier, smiling at the end. They smile because they are able to find small joys in their difficult lives, in a way Edward Norton's character couldn't. He couldn't be happy without seemingly easy illegitimate money, like how a drug addict loses the ability to find happiness in a straight life. The second man is losing control of his self-restraint and being pulled into a dangerous lifestyle by the people around him, on the verge of making a career-ruining advance on one of his students. Philip Seymour Hoffman was just incredible at playing an awkward, sexually-repressed loser. See {Boogie Nights}, {Magnolia} and {Happiness}. The third man is losing himself without realising it, in the rat race, to his bachelorism and likely to cocaine. In hindsight it was a moment where America changed suddenly, including in terms of the drug landscape, attitudes of grown men towards young women, and in the financial services industry. This film has aged incredibly well, in the sense that each of these men are brilliantly realised products of their time, and they would hopefully have no place in our world today.",
