	"review": "I've always been a big Jonah fan and everything I see him in reinforces this opinion. It makes baseball seem exciting and emotional, but only by using trite sports movie suspense techniques. The commentators let you know it's all coming down to this moment, the ambient sound fades down, you can hear the athlete's breath, the ball approaches in slow motion... I can see how this would send chills down your spine if you were a fan of the team, or knew of and admired what they achieved that season. The score is particularly good here. It's weird that Bobby Kotic is in this.",
