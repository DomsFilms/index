	"review": "Everyone lives within a system, and everyone takes what they need to survive within it, so everyone is a parasite. Blah blah blah, very poignant. More important that its message, to me, is how incredibly funny and exciting this film is. If it was just a comedy, or just a thriller, it would be great standing on one of those pillars alone. Instead it fuses the genres together into a masterpiece of entertainment. And it does have a message, but it's delivered in the exaggerated fantastical way director Bong usually employs, and like {The Wolf of Wall Street} earlier in this list, it puts fun first. I remember laughing out loud the first time I saw it. Imagine this as a six part miniseries where the episodes are about each member of the Kim family, then a part-flashback episode about the previous housekeeper, and a finale episode at the birthday party. Could it have been even better if we got to spend more time with each character's storyline? I wanted to see more of the young romance, for example. There actually is a spinoff series in development, but progress on it might have stalled.",
