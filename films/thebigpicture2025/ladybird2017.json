	"review": "Is this {Superbad} for girls? I can only assume this a very accurate and resonant portrayal of being a frustrated teenage girl in \"the Midwest of California\". Timothée is really funny, as well as the football coach. American theatre kids are just funny in general. All the characters seem like they belong so strongly in that world. Both parents are neurotic in a way Lady Bird is too young to understand or empathise with, so they just exist as her antagonists, in a way everyone who has been a teenager can probably understand. It kind of reminds me of {10 Things I Hate About You}, but with a substantially higher level of acting.",
