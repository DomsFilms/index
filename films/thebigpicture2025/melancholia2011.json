	"review": "The opening sequence is just exceptional. I wanted a bit more like that at the end, but I suppose it's just as impactful to end abruptly, and it might not have had the budget to show anything more. It's a memorable study into how the apocalypse might affect people with depression, anxiety, narcicism, denial, or how to explain it to children. Charlotte Rampling's character really made me laugh, and in a way the whole film was darkly funny. I'm glad this project finally encouraged me to waitch it.",
