	"review": "I would have picked {The Grand Budapest Hotel} for my singular rationed Wes film, but I totally understand the importance of his more surprising earlier work, with their more grounded emotional stories. All the stuff I love about all of his subsequent films is here. There's no need to list every element that comes together in harmony to create that Wes style. Nobody else could do it all without it feeling like a parody or a shameless imitation. It's not just the colour palette or the parallel lines, not just the parts generative AI can spew out. It's the way his vision is applied to every art and every decision that makes up the whole. I know that some people are losing interest and think of this film as a career high point, but in my opinion he's still got it, and I look forward to each new one like it could be the next Tenenbaums.",
