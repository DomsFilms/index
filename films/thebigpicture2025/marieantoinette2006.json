	"review": "A mood piece about the frivolous life of a young woman who lives in the most exclusive bubble possible. Marie Antoinette is famous for this one thing, and it's conveyed very well in this film without being explicitly described, in exposition or otherwise. For that, along with the incredible costumes and location, I was impressed, but there wasn't much else that appeals to me. A well-made film that I'm glad to gave seen, but I will never see it again.",
