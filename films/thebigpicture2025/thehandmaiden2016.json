	"review": "I thought it was great, and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to my parents are the slightly gratiuitous lingering shots of violence and love. The one particularly violent scene does feel necesary to help you learn about a character with a bad reputation. The plot is also about erotic literature so it's not unexpected when the sex scenes start. It's just that certain viewers might need to be warned about it first if they were expecting a more wholesome period drama. It is quite a serious and intricate plot, but it does have a few moments of thriller/action style cheese such as slow motion or the freeze-frame coin toss flashback. I really liked it and now I want to see more Park Chan-wook films, because the only other one I've seen is {Oldboy}.",
