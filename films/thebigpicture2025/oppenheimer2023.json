	"review": "Somehow edited so tightly that you feel propelled through three hours of men talking in rooms. There's a feeling of wheels in motion, that Oppy is in control of at first, until they suddenly aren't. It's my favourite Nolan movie, and the only one I can imaging giving a 10 to. Obviously the Trinity test part was the best, but unlike some people, I can easily stay engaged for the final hour. There are some incredible performances. My only criticism is about that cheesy JFK line. Part of one of the centuries' most notable cinema events, the most sophisticated film of one of the centuries' biggest directors, and filled with some of the biggest stars of its time, it absolutely deserves to be on this list. I can see how people who like superhero movies could make a serious case for {The Dark Knight} instead, and {Inception} was another very influential 21st century film, but you don't get a 10/10 from me just for setting trends.",
