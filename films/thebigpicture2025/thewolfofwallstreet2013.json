	"review": "Leo is in basically every scene of this three hour movie, while also providing voice-over, and yet it still leaves me wanting to know more about his character. Through the power of sheer charisma and fun filmmaking, he ends up as a likeable protagonist despite the story being entirely about taking advantage of others and abusing their trust. Like a film equivalent of a hundred simulant-fuelled anecdotes, you are bombarded with increasingly lavish scenes of parties, vehicular crashes, and comical arguments. It leans hard on jokes told by the narration lined up with scenes, like all the fun parts of {Goodfellas} without too much of the suffering. Jonah is fantastic in it; one of my favourite actors. It was Margot's first big movie after some TV and low budget features, and she was only 22 when it was filmed. It has to be one of the all-time <i>catapult into stardom</i> roles, and right now she's probably the western world's biggest star actress.",
