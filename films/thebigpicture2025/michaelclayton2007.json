	"review": "It's great. It moves fast and you get swept along in the drama, joining it at just the right time. It does the flash-forward starting move very effectively. You don't see Arthur snap, you learn about the situation at the same time as the characters, and it leaves you to think about exactly why it happened. There's a great bit where he buys an entire bag of baguettes. It ends in a better way than any legal drama based on a true story could.",
