	"review": "It starts off with everyone behaving so suspiciously, in a creepy and weird way, that keeps you guessing about what is going to go wrong. You might think it could just be a hypnosis thing, but that would be too obvious, and then they tease you by joking about how it might be a hypnotic sex thing. It isn't that long and it moves fast. It starts with an overtly horror opening scene, rather than wasting time with a cosy setup before anything bad starts to happen. As they say on the podcast: it was the perfect movie for the time. Now that American xenophobes have gone a bit more mask-off, maybe that time has passed now. Maybe to capture the American zeitgeist in a horror movie now, it would have to be about public institutions turning against the protagonist's demographic one-by-one, tearing their lives apart while the other half of the country cheers them on.",
	"spoilers": "My one criticism is that there is some clunky immersion-breaking exposition after the reveal. Why leave your captive/patient awake, alone and stressed out, before surgery? Why start the procedure before one patient is even in the operating theatre? It's like when the villain ties James Bond to a table and explains his master plan. It might have been nice if that information could have been conveyed in a more natural way.",
