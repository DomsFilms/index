I've heard other people say the same. Maybe demonstrating its complex idea, and the gimmick around half way through, took up so much time that the fast pace was necessary, but it really was brisk. It doesn't take the time to let you get to know the characters. It's like a worse version of Inception, but if you liked that then you'll also like this. I was disappointed the scene in the concert hall at the start didn't tie into the plot at all. It seemed completely unnecessary. One last thing to mention: the choreography and idea behind that fist fight was amazing; even better than the one in the rotating hotel in Inception.",
