	"review": "Tim Robbins is such a good actor. I've never seen anything he isn't great in. All the performances in this are good. I was hoping this would be like a Black Mirror episode but instead it comes across more like one of those boring pretentious stage plays for grown-ups (because it was). I suppose that's why there's such good acting on display; it's very talky and all about exploring these different complex characters. It's not the kind of film I usually watch, but I don't mind seeing something like this occasionally. I don't really have anything negative to say about it, except it's not my usual type of film.",
