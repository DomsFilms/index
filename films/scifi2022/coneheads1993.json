Once I'd tuned into it's sense of humour the stupid faces and squeaks they made started to make me laugh. Chris Farley is surprisingly good in this, although I feel like we should have gotten to know Connie Conehead a little better. I am not sure I could laugh at it again but I enjoyed seeing it once.",
