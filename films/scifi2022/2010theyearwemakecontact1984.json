	"review": "This isn't s masterpiece like the original but I was pleasantly surprised by it. I never thought they'd be able to continue that story but they pulled it off. It's not as mysterious, with more explicit storytelling and a slightly lame ending. But it's not like they could have kept going with the same style as the end of {2001: A Space Odyssey}. Some good sets and good performances, and I liked Helen Mirren in it despite her accent. I can imagine seeing this again.",
