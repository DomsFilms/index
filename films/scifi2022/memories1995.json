	"review": "This is an trio of short anime stories, with slightly different visual styles. It reminded me of Love Death + Robots. Each part was decent but not too complex, as there wasn't any time for twists or misdirection. There was your typical abandoned space station exploration, an exceedingly stinky man, and a story about the people of Junon from Final Fantasy VII. It looked good and I liked the style of all three parts. I really liked the 90s rave track during the end credits.",
