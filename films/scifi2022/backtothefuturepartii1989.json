    "review": "I actually enjoyed this more than the first one. It's just as fun, and has more time travel tricks, without being quite so patronising as the first film. It has some good jokes, great attention to detail with the sets and callbacks to the first film. It doesn't have the terrible Libyans. It has more action scenes/chases, and the whole scene set in the \"future\" is really memorable.",
