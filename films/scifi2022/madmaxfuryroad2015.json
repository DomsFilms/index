   "review": "Everyone's got to see this once, and it's got to be loud and bassy, preferably at the cinema. It's a spectacle, but not a deep or emotional story that can be enjoyed many times over. It's impressive just as a feat of engineering. The effort that went into the stunts and vehicles really helps. The soundtrack is great, the casting is great, and it's beautiful and will age well due to the subtle CGI. The boy from {About a Boy} is in it.",
