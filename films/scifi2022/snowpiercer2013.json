    "review": "This revolves around an interesting but silly concept that they never try too hard to explain. All you need to know is that they live on a train and can't leave. For some reason the train is safe as long as it moves very fast. All the characters were eccentric and interesting apart from the main guy, who was so gruff and plain compared to everyone else. Near the end he gets a good monologue that explains some of his demeanor, but he still stands out for being too normal in this wacky world. This is definitely destined to be cult classic. I don't know anything about the TV adaptation but I can imagine it would work quite well. They made a lot of very explicit references to steaks that I think was meant to be a puzzle for the viewer to figure out, but to me it didn't seem very subtle.",
