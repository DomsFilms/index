    "review": "I like this, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. You've definitely got to be in the right mood for it. It's tense, but not really a horror. It's gross and unsettling. Scratchy violin music all the way through to help evoke that feeling. There are some really beautiful wide shots of the Scottish scenery, and one really cool shot onboard a motorcycle. There's not really anything in the plot to make you want to see it again, but I've seen it twice now and there were enough years between each viewing that I enjoyed it again this time.",
