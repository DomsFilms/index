	"review": "When the first iPhone was announced it looked so cool and futuristic, but now the original one looks comically old and bad. When the first full artificial humans are made they'll look so futuristic, but after a few generations the originals will look like monsters. This film is pretty weird. I guess it's about the problems faced by early adopters, or maybe about the difficulty of simulating love, which we don't fully understand in the first place. The child actor is good and very creepy. Jude Law seems like a cheesy comedy sidekick, who I didn't really appreciate. It seemed very long.",
