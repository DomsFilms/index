	"review": "Unfortunately this doesn't do anything new over the original. It's like how Stranger Things season 2 played it safe and used the same characters and same monsters, and ended up being very predictable. It's not technically bad but it didn't need to exist and I now realise I didn't need to see it at all despite really enjoying the original. The first one also had some more intense plot points too, like the scene at the start and the bit in the bathtub.",
