	"review": "Oof. This was released a month after {The Matrix} and is not nearly as memorable. It has a noir detective style rather than being an action movie. It's a good idea, but {The Matrix} explores the same concept in such a more exciting way. Unfortunately this film's most powerful moment is spoiled by the poster/box art itself. It might have been cool to go in without any preconceptions and without having seen the poster.",
