	"review": "This is a decent Disney movie. When I was a child I wanted to see this and Treasure Planet, but ended up waiting until adulthood to get around to them. Treasure Planet is pretty but occasionally uses 3D CGI that has aged very badly and stands out from the regular Disney style. This film still looks great. It uses some Futurama-style flat colour 3D that blends in blends in well, and there are no low-res textures or basic particle effect explosions like Treasure Planet. The pacing seems so fast in this, and it is probably too short, but I suppose this is because animation screen time is expensive and children prefer short films. The journey to Atlantis is over so quickly and they don't spent nearly enough time in the cool submarine. The crew are so rude at first that it's hard to like them until right near the end. The environment art is great. As a kid I probably would have loved it, along with Treasure Planet and The Road to El Dorado.",
