    "review": "Don't let my category ratings fool you. This is definitely a sci-fi movie about interdimensional travel. It's very similar to Mary Poppins, but not as good. I even read they initially wanted to cast Julie Andrews. Some, but not all, of the songs are memorable. I like it more than Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins 2.",
