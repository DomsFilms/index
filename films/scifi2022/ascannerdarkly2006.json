	"review": "Some people don't like this at all but I do. The book is confusing and told from the perspective of someone with a loose grip on reality, so I don't mind that the movie is hard to follow too. It's very faithful to the book, but it cuts too much out and breezes past an important expository scene about neuropsychology that should be made more clear to the viewer. Showing someone descend into madness in a movie is hard because there's not enough time to make it seem like a gradual slow process. I like the style, and I think RDJ is great in it.",
