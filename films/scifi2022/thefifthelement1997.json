    "review": "This is like the Flash Gordon of the 90s. I don't love it, but I've seen it twice now, 10 years apart, and it's fun enough. Very wacky, almost like a Star Wars themed pantomime. The music and sound is good. The CGI seems to have aged quite well. Costume design is certainly memorable. I personally find Chris Tucker's character a little too annoying, and the big threat they face is very generic and underdeveloped.",
