	"review": "This is probably the best Arnie movie and it's aged very well. Some parts drag on a bit as he just doesn't die each time he crashes or explodes, but on the other hand you couldn't make a movie with a plot this simple work if he died before the end. There's a hipstery bar in Reading where a CRT TV on the floor shows old movies on VHS all night, and this strikes me as exactly the kind of movie which would look more stylish with some analogue noise and warping. The perfect background aesthetic movie that you can dip in and out of and still know what's going on. At the end, when Sarah is meant to be wiser and more resourceful, she's done a lot of growing up and is driving through a desert in Mexico. She stops at a gas station and the attendant walks up to her. I found it very funny how she looked down at her phrase book for such a long long time before saying \"gasolina por favor\".",
