    "review": "Some people say the plot is bad in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Those people are WRONG, and if they thought a couple of political scenes were so boring then they've probably become Avengers fans these days. I'm no Star Wars fan and these films are definitely flawed, but I think the prequels have the best story, if not the best dialogue. The original trilogy is fun but has such a simple simple story. The Disney films are boring and reek of design by committee. The prequels attempted something more unique and interesting, for better or worse. The music in this film is fantastic of course, and the CGI has aged well. Very entertaining for children but not so much for adults. The worldbuilding is particularly good in the prequels, although some characters are clearly based on racial stereotypes.",
