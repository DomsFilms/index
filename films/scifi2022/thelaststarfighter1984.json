	"review": "I hadn't heard of this film before this month. It is definitely cult classic material and has aged much better than The Flight of the Navigator in my opinion. It's a silly Star Wars and Tron knock-off, but the child actors aren't annoying and it's full of amusing 80s traits. The very early 3D CGI looks weirdly good, except for the terrible textures on the asteroids.",
