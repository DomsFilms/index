    "review": "This film looks amazing for 1989. A really impressive amount of detail, effects, lighting, underwater shots etc. I read that it took 6 months to produce the 75 seconds where you can see the water tentacle. It has some crazy scenes like the incredibly intense CPR and the descent into the abyss. In many ways this film is incredible, so it's a shame about the characters, dialogue, plot and ending...",
