	"review": "I think this film is pretty great, but it's one that's got to be loud and in a cinema-like room, otherwise it might come across as boring. Michael Caine's character is a bit silly; his job is convince the dad to leave his family behind forever, just after we're introduced to the guy and shown how much he cares for them, and he only has a few minutes to do it. He seems like a total wildcard, no different to a magician's trick designer/superhero's butler/dream invasion professor. This film looks like very hard sci-fi, but I'm sure some nerds have unraveled all of its scientific claims. The soundtrack is great, as you'd expect.",
