	"review": "The animation on this has held up really well. It looks great and mixes that 2D and 3D style so well. The music is good too. I suppose this has become a bit of cult classic children's movie. Good jokes and characters, powerful ending. It's a good as I remembered from my childhood and it's a near-perfect family movie.",
