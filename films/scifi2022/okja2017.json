    "review": "I loved this. I liked its style of humour, and the characters are all so wacky and memorable. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the most unsettling version of {Ace Ventura}. Ojka looked very good and the mountain scenery was nice. I liked the soundtrack too. It reminded me of the Playstation game {Abe's Oddysee}, which is also a darkly humorous anti-corporation story about meat.",
