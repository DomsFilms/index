    "review": "The poster/VHS cover for this movie is comically bad, and Blade looks like a 1998 videogame character in it. Despite being total nonsense, Mr Blade delivers exposition with such an authoritative tone that you can just about get swept up in it, hence the believability score. There's cool music and it and like The Matrix it has people choosing to wear leather trenchcoats to nightclubs.",
