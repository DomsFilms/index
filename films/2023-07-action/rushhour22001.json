    "review": "This is a bit of a mess. The classic sequel that appears like a jumble of discarded ideas from the writing process of the original. Some of the jokes have aged incredibly poorly, but I find it funny to see what we used to be able to get away with back then. I admit I laughed at the Toto joke. Carter is so incompetent in this one that he seems like a sleazy cartoon character who just can't comprehend any situation he's in unless it's about meeting attractive young women.",
