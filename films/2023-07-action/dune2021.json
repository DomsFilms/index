    "review": "I reviewed this in my first horror marathon, because it had just come out and I loved it. Its really loud and epic; clearly made for the cinema and with great sound design. The sets are very sparse, like every interior is an empty concrete room and every exterior is the desert. Yet it remains visually interesting because of the the way the light hits all the smoke, dust and fog they used. The book contains so much exposition, and the solution here is to deliver as much as it as possible through costimes, props, music, vehicles and sand.",
