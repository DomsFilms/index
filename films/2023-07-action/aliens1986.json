    "review": "Another Jim Cam classic, but I prefer Alien. Just like Terminator 2 it's an amazing spectacle but the plot is one dimensional; escape from the aliens instead of escape from the robot. Like Alien you first see the crew behaving like real humans rather than seeing explicit introductions. Did this movie invent the auto-turret that is in so many videogames? I've definitely heard quotes from this movie in games.",
