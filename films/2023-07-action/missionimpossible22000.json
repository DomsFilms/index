    "review": "I think this has aged well, if you're nostalgic about the early 2000s like I am. It opens with a very pre-9/11 airplane hijacking scene, there are crazy looking plastic phones, a first generation Audi TT and 996 911, lots of sports sunglasses. Tom Cruise's hair is great in this one. The story is much less chaotic and baffling than the first in the series, but It's also farfetched and silly. I liked the first act the most and started to grow a little bored towards the end.\n",
