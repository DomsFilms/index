    "review": "I love Sam Raimi's movies. Not so sure about the man himself though... Wild west fast draw duels are the perfect home for the Raimi face zoom. I sometimes lost interest during this film between the duels, but each duel was amazing. I also liked the gun buying scene, which felt like yet another homage to the Taxi Driver gun salesman scene.",
