   "review": "Now this is a real action movie. Cool stunts, cool locations, fast moving and cutting camera, one dimensional characters who announce their emotions and motivations out loud, dogshit plot about an unexplained macguffin. If we knew anything about why Philip Seymour Hoffman was doing what he was doing, he'd be a great villain. Simon Pegg is a fun addition. As exciting as it is, the whole thing is dragged down by the insulting plot; the first 35 minutes are irrelevant, and the rest don't give you anything to think about either. You see Tom Cruise's wife tied to a chair and threatened with death on three occasions, so by the third time you don't care about her at all. The Vatican heist is the only scene I will remember.\n",
