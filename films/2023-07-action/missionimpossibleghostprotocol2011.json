    "review": "I had intel that this series was going to get better if I stuck with it, and it's true. Although Cruise suddenly starts to look quite old in this one, I feel like it's a reboot where they finally figured out what they want M:I to be. It doesn't embarrass itself by trying to be too serious, kind of like the modern day equivalent of Roger Moore Bond movies. Simon Pegg is so watchable in this, stunts are next-level bombastic, a great film to switch your brain off and enjoy, then forget.",
