    "review": "I am writing this the morning after watching it, and I already don't quite remember how it ended. I enjoyed it just as much as the previous one in the series, for all the same reasons. It is slightly lighter on bombast and the story makes less sense. They acknowledge that the IMF only make their own problems, which was funny and left me feeling validated in my view that the real authorities like the army and FBI could handle all of these crises competently, without resorting to crazy heists. The IMF perform heists in situations where the police would just get a warrant, because of their own constraint to maintain their secrecy. It's starts with that amazing stunt on the plane, and it's a shame there's no big finale stunt. The opera scene is an extremely cool location, wasted on a assassination plot point that is completely unnecessary.",
