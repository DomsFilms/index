    "review": "In this film, cops pursuing a white convict accidentally bust into a black families house in plain clothes and kill an innocent man as he tries to defend himself. They show no remorse and quickly forget about the incident. So in that sense it's very realistic. I don't think I ever want to see this film again, because a lot of the excitement depends on wanting to find out what happened to Harrison Ford's wife and why, but I really enjoyed my first viewing of it.\n",
