Between this and <i>Infinity Pool</i> it looks like he could end up making a load of good, but never perfect, high concept body/sci-fi horror movies. I saw the uncut version which is the same except for a little bit of extended gore, and at least one additional erect penis. I really liked the spiralling skyscraper shot. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the characters.",
