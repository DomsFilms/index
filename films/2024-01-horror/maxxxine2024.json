    "review": "It's a B movie with A ideas! But the problem is that it's ideas don't synergise very well with each other and they didn't all need to be here. X and Pearl are more simple and pure, while this has a bit too much going on, with unimportant characters and scenes thrown together. Having said that, it's really fun to watch. There's a very uncomfortable sounding scene with a squeaky highlighter pen. There's a drug snorting scene where you see her nostril all gunked up with the stuff. Kevin Bacon is brilliant in this. There's a funicular that they misidentify in a way I found annoying, but that's possibly intentional.",
