At first I was finding it hard to enjoy because all the characters were so unlikeable, but by the end I'd changed my mind. I thought of them like a gang of asshole friends that you just have to stick with no matter what, in case nobody else is there for them, or worse, because you fear you're just as much of an asshole. Anyway it starts with the worlds most miserable holiday, and gets worse from there. Very little is revealed until the last 20 mins, and the ending was a bold choice.",
