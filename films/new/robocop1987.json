	"review": "I had assumed this film was more child-friendly, like it was one of those 80s action films and shows designed to launch a line of toys. I knew there was a crowdsourced remake where he shoots everyone's dick off, so I'd assumed the joke there was that they'd turned a more innocent original film into a comedically violent parody. It turns out I was totally wrong and the original is so full of dick-shootingly violent excess that it didn't really need parody.",
