	"review": "This is exactly more of the same after Clerks, but it's not as good. Everyone wants to up the ante when making a sequel, but when the original is just about people hanging out, raising the stakes made it seem like they tried too hard. It lost some of its chill, but it was still funny. They say \"chud\" lots of times and you can't argue with that. It's comedy gold.",
