	"review": "They knew exactly how to use Arnie in this, greasing him up and letting him flex his muscles and face in close-up. I think I liked it more than {Robocop}, because the world was more vivid at the humour was at least a little bit more subtle. I was amazed at how many lines I recognised from clips in 90s electronic music.",
