	"review": "I found this very nice and relaxing. The story doesn't seem that important compared to other aspect of the film. There is only ever mild peril depicted and you're not really worried about any character being hurt. It's beautifully drawn and animated. You could probably watch this on mute with some music playing instead, and still enjoy it. I wasn't very impressed with the English voice acting, but there's also an American dub which might be better. Both English variants have some famous names in the cast. The way the grass and foliage looked was the best part for me.",
