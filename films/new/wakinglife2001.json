	"review": "I like A Scanner Darkly more than this. The art style is a bit wobbly here but they nailed it for A Scanner Darkly. The way this film dips into various philosophical ideas I'm interested in means I'm going to see it again sooner rather than later. There's an album I like by Abakus that uses quotes from this film heavily.",
