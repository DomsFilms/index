    "review": "I liked this a lot. I recently watched Spaced and it was similar to that. It got progressively siller, while blending quirky jokes with real the characters struggles in their directionless lives. My criticisms are: it looked like shit, not just because it was black and white, but because of the low quality camera in general, and also they recited the previous events to each other quite often in a weird way. If I've seen an event happen on screen, I only need to see one character tell another character about it later if the conversation provides new information.",
