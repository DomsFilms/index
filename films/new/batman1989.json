	"review": "I found this really funny because Batman's cowl is very stiff and he can't move his neck properly. So whenever he needs to look around he has to move his whole upper body. There's a moment where he has to bend backwards with his hips to look up, like a Lego man. The city architecture was the coolest part of this, and some of the interior sets looked like video game levels. I liked the soundtrack. Unfortunately it loses some points for having a relatively dull plot. I'm no Batman expert but he seems to kill a lot of goons in this, and I thought that wasn't how he operated.",
