    "review": "I'm a big Wes Anderson fan so I knew I'd like this and had been looking forward to it. Even though he has a very specific style he can apply it to different stories and tones. Fantastic Mr Fox can appeal to children, Moonrise Kingdom can appeal to young adults, and The Darjeeling Limited is drier and more for the discerning adult. This is more like the latter, although it's a little wackier. Like a magazine it has several disconnected short stories. Maybe you can write characters in a different way when you know they will only exist for 25 minutes. Very different to any other film you might have seen, unless you've seen any Wes Anderson film.",
