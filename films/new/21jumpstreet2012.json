	"review": "Kanye said watching this film was transformative for him, but I'm beginning to think he's just dumb. I didn't particularly like the main characters, but some of the supporting characters are very funny. I think that part of the storyline with the science teacher must have been cut out, as she's not in it much and her storyline goes nowhere. The scene where they're high in front of the sports coach was very funny.",
