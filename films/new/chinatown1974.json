    "review": "I like atmospheric, meandering stories like this. You can absorb the slice of life without your attention being grabbed by a fast-moving plot. Maybe this film would be considered a little boring by modern standards, and it would certainly have a car chase and shootout if made for a broad audience today. Unsurprisingly, Jack Nicholson is good in this. It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for but it was great.",
