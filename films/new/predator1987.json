	"review": "This was very cheesy but fun. The effects still looked good, except for the resolution of the Predator's vision. It is good for a silly 80s action movie, but it doesn't offer anything more than that. I might have expected it to be better as I know it started a franchise. My friend pointed out that Arnie regularly poses in bodybuilder-flex positions during this movie for no reason, and then I started to notice it a lot and it made me laugh.",
