	"review": "It looks incredible. Particularly the wide shots of the camp, the bridge and the jungle. I can see why it's so revered, but ultimately I don't think it works quite as well any more because it's so incredibly slow. I felt like I was in the punishment hut, having to watch some shots without dialogue that last minutes. The seemingly dated rule about officers not doing labour probably doesn't help either, but I understand it in this context, and the film does a great job of earning my respect for Alec Guinness' character as a leader. {The Great Escape} is more exciting and dynamic, but this has a more interesting psychological edge.",
