	"review": "Guillermo del Toro's first film. It does some unique things with the classic horror concept it uses (but I won't spoil it here). It clearly had a low budget, but was ambitious, and had many elements you see again in his other films. Unfortunately it was a little forgettable, maybe because I saw so many horror films in October, this one blended in with them. if I'd watched this in October it would have definitely felt like one of the filler films I watched between some of the bigger ones. Ron Perlman is in it and his character is weird. Dumb and immature, but he's such a big and intimidating guy. His baggy 90s suit makes him look even bigger.",
