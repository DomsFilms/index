	"review": "I thought this would suck, but it was a pleasant surprise when I realised, right in the first scene, that it was going to be very funny. The requests for Jonathan, the annoying paladin, Hugh Grant's character, were all funny to me. There are some practical effects that look good, like the flipping gravity, but there are also CGI scenes that look bad by today's standards. I liked that it explored edge-case portal physics that nerds have been thinking about since 2007.",
	"spoilers": "I loved how the main characters had a unwavering plutonic relationship without any romantic jeopardy. That doesn't feel very common in movies like this.",
