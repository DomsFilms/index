	"review": "This is crazy. Maybe I need to stop this series of reviews, because I've seen a film that I just don't know how to review at all. I have no idea if this is good. It made me laugh, sometimes at its jokes, but also sometimes because I was confused and nervous. It uses some very silly camera work and editing. There are some bizarre puppet props like the talking melon in the background. Never seen anything quite like this.",
