    "review": "I really liked this. It's like the party scenes from {The Wolf of Wall Street}, but for three hours of constant partying. Some critics said it was too excessive, but I'm sure this was a wise stylistic choice, as it's about the excessive lifestyles of early Hollywood stars. It's a maximalist movie with an amazing original soundtrack.",
