    "review": "Maybe I've ruined this film for myself by not seeing it before Dory was CANCELLED. It was fine; better than anything from DreamWorks, as is usually the case with Pixar. Just more of the same really, and not as endearing as the first one for me. Disney sure do produce a lot of movies about unsupervised animals making journeys through civilisation to get back home...",
