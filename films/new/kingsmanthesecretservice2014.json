    "review": "This was extremely lame, and I found it harder to concentrate on the movie as it got closer to the end. It has nothing to offer except some almost Edgar Wright style camerawork during fight scenes, (especially the first umbrella one). An example of how dull it became towards the end is: they use the same set with a crossroads of corridors in the evil base, with a red floor and rough rock walls, so many times that it's obvious the actor is running past the same exact scenery over and over. There's a fight scene in that room, then he leaves to have a chat with his mentor, then he gets a new weapon and has another fight scene against the same henchmen in the same room minutes later. I had downloaded this and it's sequel, but after watching it, I immediately deleted both. I have no interest in seeing what happens next for these characters. Avengers-style quips and explosions just aren't for me.",
