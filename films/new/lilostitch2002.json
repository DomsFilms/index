	"review": "I liked the first act, and found it very funny. Unfortunately the rest of the movie plays out in a very predictable way. There aren't many twists or turns, or emotional journeys here. Stitch just scrambles around evading capture in scene after scene. It could have been a tv show where the bounty hunter's plans are foiled in each episode. It doesn't look as good as some other Disney films of the time, for example The Lion King. It's also probably not as rewatchable either because it's not a musical with catchy original songs.",
