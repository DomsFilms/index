    "review": "Friendship ended with Nemo. Now Ponyo is my best friend. The music in this film is incredible, and the animation is great too. Just a really happy, not too weird, Studio Ghibli film. Like some of their more recent ones it even has a decent English dub. With animation all languages are technically dubbed, so it's much more acceptable to watch than a dubbed live action film in my opinion. The only flaw was that the lyrics in the end credits song were a little awkward in English as they looked for similar lines with the same number of syllables. My favourite parts were when there was any of the orchestral or choral soundtrack playing, and whenever they were riding in that sweet hot hatchback. I think I preferred {Porco Rosso} personally, but this was still excellent. Ponyo's dad looks like Ronnie Wood.",
