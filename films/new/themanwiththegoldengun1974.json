	"review": "I have finally seen every Bond movie. My conclusion: they're all underwhelming. The very best couple of Bonds are 8/10s, and most are 5s and below. I'd head that this one was the worst, but I'm not sure if this was any worse than {Octopussy}. Their take on solar power made me laugh. The shipwreck set was insane. It was quite sexist and racist. The american guy was insufferable and their big car jump stunt was ruined by some editing that made it look like a short and slow run up, as well as some heinous boing-dubbing. Bond doesn't kill many henchmen in this one, and it's not quite like some of the other Bond stories. Some people enjoy Roger Moore as Bond because his films are so cheesy, but this one wasn't nearly as fun as some of his others. Christopher Lee was OK.",
