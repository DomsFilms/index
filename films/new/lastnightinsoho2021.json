	"review": "It was really easy to get caught up in the story, as it moved quite fast and was tense and unpredictable all the way through. Like all Edgar Wright films it looks great and has fast and fun editing. It's kind of funny, although comedy is less of a focus than his previous films and some parts are really sinister. The first time she dreams, when the camera is under the duvet, is a really cool bit. The music is great.",
