	"review": "This is definitely like a higher budget, better produced {Chungking Express}. I really liked the 60s sets and fashion. There are some weird cuts in this film where they confuse you with the continuity, like when they show the characters arriving home after a day of work, entering their apartments, and then cut to them arriving again on another day, warping back to the other side of the set. It's very strange to imagine this film having a sci-fi sequel.",
