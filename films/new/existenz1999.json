    "review": "This is nuts. It's so much like <i>The Matrix</i>, and was released so shortly before, that it appears to have been completely forgotten in the shadow of the better film. It has some big ideas and I enjoyed it a lot. They are some terrible accents, and a funny justification of them later. They have a lot of fun with the spine holes. Completely unpredictable and dreamlike in places, and a classic videogame movie written by someone who has no idea what a videogame is.",
