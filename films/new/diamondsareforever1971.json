    "review": "This is like, really bad. They were already leaning heavily into the cheesy Roger Moore style with Sean Connery's last entry. Some of the acting from supporting roles is hilarious. Bond kicks a cat across the room. It gets some points for being quite a good looking film. In some scenes I liked the elaborate sets and the colours used. I was also entertained in a way, by the baffling and unpredictable story. Bond drowns someone in moisturiser. There are these two comedy assassin characters but they were only funny to me because of how bad their dialogue was. Bond befriends a rat.",
