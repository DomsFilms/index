    "review": "This is a well executed, but ultimately generic spooky basement horror movie. It's got the crazy multi-generational family, cursed house that everyone in the neighbourhood knows about, monster that you only catch glimses of. It's like that one really scary episode of <i>The X-Files</i>. There were a few moments I loved, but I get the feeling this will blend in with a lot of other horror movies in my memory, given a few years.",
    "spoilers": "The first section, before the introduction of Justin Long, is amazing on it's own as a short film. It gets a lot sillier after that.",
