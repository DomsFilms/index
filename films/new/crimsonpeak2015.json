    "review": "I think they may have filtered this to seem like the viewer is red-green colour blind: it ties into the story. Unfortunately this wasn't so great. In a few ways it reminded me a lot of The Prestige, but it's not nearly as good. I really wanted to like it more, as it looks pretty and has a really cool house set, but I just wasn't very gripped by the story, and it didn't have any big twists or raise any philosophical questions like the prestige does. I'm sure this will prove to be forgettable for me.",
