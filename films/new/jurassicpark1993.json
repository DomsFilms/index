    "review": "Hold on to your butts because this is controversial: I think this film is just ok. Spielberg had already done a good monster movie with deep characters who had an interesting relationship with the beast: Jaws. He'd already done fantasy adventure movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark. He'd already done fun family movies like E.T. This film is a family monster fantasy adventure, but it doesn't excell in any of those categories. The effects were impressive when it was realeased, but now that it's easy to see past them the film just seems average. Some of the characters have no personally at all and are just there to get eaten. The best scene is where the velociraptors show up. It's weirdly quiet for such a big, action-packed movie. there's not as much music as I expected. At the end they fly away in a totally silent helicopter.",
