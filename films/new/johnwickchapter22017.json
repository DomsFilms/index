	"review": "I liked the first John Wick and it felt like it could have been a nice a self-contained movie without spawning a franchise. This movie made me think they went from having no plans for a sequel, to having hasty plans for a franchise based on the first one's success. They spend some time in this movie trying to build a Wickverse than I'm not interested at all, and the rest of it is all about assassins constantly jumping out at John Wick and trying to kill him. In a way I wish I hadn't seen it and would have been happier having only one John Wick movie in my memory. I assume I would feel the same way if I ever watched a Taken sequel.",
