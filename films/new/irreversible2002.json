	"review": "An intensely violent, confusing, dizzying, unpleasant watch. The main character is a complete moron who's behaviour somehow gets worse despite the {Memento} style backwards plot. All of the dialogue is people angrily asking questions to people who are unwilling or unable to answer. I begrudgingly admit it's good, despite being hard to watch, sometimes slow and frustrating, and sometimes totally horrible. The night after watching this, I had a dream where I had to sit through it all again, but with a dog sleeping on my lap for emotional support.",
