	"review": "Much funnier than I expected. It was brilliant, but I'm not sure I want to see it again and I don't think I learned anything about myself or the world by watching. It could easily be set in the same world as {Triangle Of Sadness} or {Succession}. All of my specific thoughts are in the spoiler section below.",
	"spoilers": "I thought it was building up to a big courtroom debate scene, but when they finally reach the court they get chastised by the judge for all being idiots, and promptly thrown out. I loved how Vanya was confident and rebellious when his parents were on the other side of the world, started to freak out when they were on their way, and was powerless in their presence. I also like how the ending really invited me to speculate about all the emotions swirling in her head.",
