    "review": "I heard this was amazing, and I was amazed as can be. Cate Blanchett's performance is just incredible and I think she was robbed at the Oscars. I love how this film doesn't give you all the answers, or even all the information, so you can play detective and speculate on what the character deserves and when her behaviour crosses the line. It seems like someone obsessed over this script and refined it more than any other movie I can think of.",
    "spoilers": "I love how the viral footage of her teaching a class is edited to attract more clicks and make her look worse, but the unintended consequence is that Tár can only see how the edit was unfair and dishonest, rather than becoming aware of her own mistakes. Maybe she'd have responded with more humility if she saw the unedited footage. It's an example of how journalists can undermine the importance of their work if they strive too hard for commercial/viral success. The ending is incredible: at the start she says that controlling time is the most important part of her job, yet at the end she must wear headphones with a click track so she can synchronise the orchestra with the projected video. For someone who has been at the very top of her field and is such a perfectionist, you can tell that this must hurt her. She must think of it as just a mundane job, compared to the art she loves. And yet as a viewer it seems like a respectable enough position. I think about this film all the time.",
