    "review": "Very low budget horror set in an interesting location. I find it disappointing that some Italian films from this era are entirely dubbed, and this one in particular sounds bad. The actors were speaking english, but all of the sound for the movie, including english dialogue was added in post. So the voice acting is not that great, and it doesn't quite line up with their mouth movements. The sound effects sound cheap and underwhelming compared to what you see happening on screen.",
