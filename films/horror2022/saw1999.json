I expect the subsequent films in the franchise get more unpleasant as there must have been pressure to up the ante, and an increased CGI budget. There is some insane editing that I'm not sure how to describe, where a load of close-ups are cut together very quickly. It happens three times in the film and made me laugh. I suppose this was influenced by films like Seven or the Hannibal story, but with more of indulgence in the villain's crazy schemes. It's trashy but fun and I'm glad I've finally seen one of these, but I have no desire to keep going through the series.",
