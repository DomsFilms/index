	"review": "There's one specific cut in this movie, about half way through, where it made me think a receptionist had a desk underneath a doctor's desk. Like they had a bunk-desk situation going on. They didn't but the movement of the character as the shots are edited together fooled me the first time I saw it. Anyway, this was great. Really gross, quite simple revenge story full of bloody violence. The music is good. It's weird and not quite fitting for this dark story, which made it stand out more. The lighting in some of the night scenes was great. It's super violent and quite long, and there are several showdowns between the main opposing characters that made me think I was about to see the ending, only for it to continue with another encounter a few minutes later. I liked some of the sets they used, like the farm, and the strange house towards the end.",
