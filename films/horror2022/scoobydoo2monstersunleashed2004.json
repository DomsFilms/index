    "review": "This is one of those terrible children's films where your kids might love it, and you'll wish they were into something more tasteful that you could enjoy too. I think the titular dog is the worst character in the franchise (yes, worse than Scrappy), as he exists only for comedy with no development or drama. Too often a joke occurs, only for Scoob to announce what just happened and laugh at it. His voice is slow so it's this tedious process you have to sit through, after the punchline has already happened. If Shaggy were to slip on a banana skin and fall to the floor with a crash, the joke is already over before it cuts to Scoob saying: {\"RUH ROH RSHAGGY. RWATCH ROUT RFOR RTHOSE RBANANA RSKINS. REHEHEHEHE.\"} Maybe reaction shots after jokes are more popular in children's content to highlight the jokes and teach them when to laugh, but it's a drag for adults. There were also three separate jokes about goo splatting into people's faces. A couple of jokes made me laugh but they were snarky comments that didn't have the painstaking delivery I've been criticising here. The story isn't terrible and I found myself thinking the film could be mercifully shorter, funnier, and better if the dog was cut out entirely. Maybe it's time to kill him off...",
