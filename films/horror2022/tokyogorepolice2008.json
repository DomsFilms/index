	"review": "This is full of unrealistic but comical gore and body horror. It's enjoyable as a bad, cheesy movie and it didn't bother me that it's designed to look older and less intentionally schlocky than it really is. The problem was that I never really got into the story. It can't be entirely full of gory fight scenes so they give you rest with some dialogue to break up the action. I found myself zoning out from those parts towards the end and now I couldn't tell you what really happened.",
