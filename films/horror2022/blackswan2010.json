    "review": "This is great. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are both very good in it. It's like a more chaotic and hallucinatory version of {Whiplash}. Really uncomfortable to watch, you spend the whole film thinking something terrible is going to happen at the end. The nature of the body horror elements really bothered me. I find breaking limbs and ingrown hair really disgusting.",
