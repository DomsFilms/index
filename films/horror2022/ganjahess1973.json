	"review": "This was originally meant to be a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of {Blacula}, but the director had more artistic aspirations, and it ended up quite intelligent and interesting. It's not good, but it's also not an embarrassing film to have in your collection. Low budget and low fidelity, but worth seeing if you crave some novelty after three weeks of genre films.",
