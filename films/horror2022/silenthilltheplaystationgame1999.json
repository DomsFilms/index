	"review": "Not as good as Resident Evil 2, which was released the year before. The graphics are good for the first PlayStation if you ignore the draw distance, but it's hard to do so as it's so incredibly short. I like the constant ominous sounds and the general atmosphere in the game. I liked how much you rely on filling in a paper map with notes as you explore. Some of the weak points are the repetitive enemies and the vague puzzles. It's no masterpiece but it did start a series that hit some real high points later on. The North American box art for this game is amusingly bad.",
