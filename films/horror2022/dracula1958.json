	"review": "I understand that this was a significant film at the time of release, it moved the genre forward, used some novel effects, and was probably very exciting at the time. But by today's standards I just don't think it's that interesting to watch. Now it's just some old film, far less exciting than modern horror and less of a historical curio than Nosferatu. Some elements make it an enjoyable watch, though not all intentional: unsurprisingly Christopher Lee is good as Dracula, there is some comedy in the incredibly flippant way the women in the film are treated, and the death effect for Dracula made me laugh. Ultimately, if you're going to watch one old Dracula film then I don't think it should be this one. I need to see a few more before I can comfortably settle on a favourite.",
