	"review": "This is very horrible, but not very exciting. It's quite like a real American documentary, in that they hold all the important information back until near the end, and they spread the information they have thinly throughout a long runtime. The only difference between this and a real show is: the real one would probably only have 2 minutes of tape footage and they'd show it over and over, either side of the ad breaks. I liked the music, but it's not used very much. It has some decent twists, but I can't recommend it over some other found footage films.",
