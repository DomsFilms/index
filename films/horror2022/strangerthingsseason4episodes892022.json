	"review": "How Netflix has fallen. It has changed from being a mark of quality to the Aldi of television, offering only low budget imitations of that film you wanted to watch. In terms of their own content there has clearly been some pressure to cut costs and focus on crowd pleasers rather than anything too niche or risky. The Dark Crystal show was cancelled and now I'm going to take out my frustration on Stranger Things. What made season one so good was how you discovered more about the upside down and the monster at the same time as the characters. Their peaceful lives were torn apart in such an exciting and unpredictable way. Season one episode three is just the perfect episode of television in my opinion, and it always gives me chills. Seasons two onwards just feel like they're going through the motions, churning out as much content as they can before the children grow too old. The characters already know the stakes so there's less mystique as the heroes grind out similar quests. Seasons two onwards have felt like The Hobbit trilogy to me: an attempt at capturing what made the original so good, failing to match it beyond a superficial level. The show is also full of quips and meme-bait now. If you like Stevens Spielberg and King then I highly recommend seeing season one of this show; the ending is satisfying and you could comfortably stop there. If you like The Avengers and Star Wars, favouring quantity over quality, seeing the same world get saved over and over, then you've got plenty more episodes to enjoy. It is all beautifully filmed though, and everyone likes the soundtrack.",
