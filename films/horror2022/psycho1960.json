	"review": "This is great, but it really shows how much films changed throughout the 1960s. Not just because it's black and white, but the pacing of the story, ending on an exposition dump, and having conversations without any cuts where four characters are all in the frame talking at each other and facing towards the camera like they're on stage. I didn't think Janet Leigh's performance was particularly good compared to the rest of the cast, or maybe it was that her acting style seemed more old-fashioned than the rest. The shower scene is not actually that great, but I understand it was held back by the rules of what they could show at the time.",
