	"review": "This is quite a generic modern horror film. A family moves to a dark house in an American suburbia and a guy in a horrible costume jumps out in front of the camera repeatedly. It's quite scary, although the monster is a bit silly and doesn't have a very scary name. Some of the jump scares were fresh ideas, although several were just boring old faces popping out of the darkness. Usually I get a feel of what the film rating should be before the end, but in this case the quality of the story really depended on the ending. I liked the music as he watched each tape. I also liked this one particular shot where he falls asleep until dawn.",
