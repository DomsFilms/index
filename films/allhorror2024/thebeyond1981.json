	"review": "There's some really wet gore in this movie, like they had to water down their fake blood because of the low budget. It's another one of those italian horror movies where they didn't record any sound and dubbed the whole thing, to terrible effect. There is a guy who looks like PS1 Hagrid and another guy with a face made of porridge. In general it is an interesting idea that is quite poorly executed, but I enjoyed the wacky death scenes, silly gore and the complete non sequitur spider bit. I laughed when the doctor said he didn't beleive in anything supernatural, and still started blasting fairly normal looking hospital patients with his gun the moment he saw them groaning like zombies. If you want to put a jump scare in your movie and have it be shocking, you can't show the protagonist reacting and screaming before cutting to the shocking thing they can see. Maybe it works for emotionally scary moments like discovering the body of a dead friend, but not for pop-up monsters.",
