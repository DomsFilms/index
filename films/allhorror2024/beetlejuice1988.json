	"review": "This is great. It is all about the strange jokes and the story doesn't matter at all. It barely has an ending; it just runs out of gags and then stops. I'm still laughing at the mask Geena Davis wears. I find it strange that films like {Spaceballs} and {The Princess Bride} are heralded as 80s classics, when this is much better. Maybe it was a bigger deal in the USA. I think the sequel is going to draw a lot of attention to it: that's why I saw it, and now I'm excited for more.",
