	"review": "I love how subtle the humour is in this. Because it's old, it has become harder over time to know what is an intentional mockumentary joke and what was considered normal television entertainment at the time. It was funny how rude Michael Parkinson was and how he cut people off quickly, like they do during real live TV events. It was funny how inane Craig Charles' contributions were, like he was just there to keep the little neighbourhood crowd entertained throughout the night and stop them walking away in boredom.  Only the ending is overtly silly, like a footnote explaining that they wanted you to laugh, and you were right to do so, during the rest of the mostly deadpan show. I laughed so much!",
