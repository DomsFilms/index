	"review": "This is kind of like a stage play, set in one room where people keep showing up through a door on the back wall at dramatic times. It's like {Arsenic and Old Lace}. I'd be pissed off if people kept letting themselves in like that. Martin Sheen even goes inside Gordon's house without knocking: how rude! They paid their rent three years in advance and the landlady is still busting their balls? It's not much of a horror movie but it's certainly creepy. It's a real product of the 70s, in attitudes and aesthetics. There's an extremely noticeable dubbed cork pop sound effect that made me laugh.",
