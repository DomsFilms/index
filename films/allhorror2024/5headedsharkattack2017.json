	"review": "With a higher budget, but fewer original ideas, less ambition and no celebrity guest appearances, this is much less enjoyable than 3-Headed Shark Attack. Their callbacks to the previous film(s) do not land here, and instead just remind you of the fact they are creatively bankrupt and pushing the limits on audience tolerance. Like how The Room would be less popular if it was slightly more competently made, this has left the realm of <i>so bad it's good,</i> and I have nothing positive to say about it at all.",
