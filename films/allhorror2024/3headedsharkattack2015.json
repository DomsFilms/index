    "review": "This is one of those terrible Sci-Fi channel straight-to-TV movies. I read that the production company is based in Burbank but is not affiliated with the Screen Actors Guild, so the staff suffer harsh conditions while filming without any union rules. It was complete trash, but I happened to see it under the right circumstances to enjoy it. Each line was delivered like they were filmed one at a time, the most laboured line reads, even during what was meant to be a flowing conversation. The runtime was padded out with repetitive reaction shots and slow motion montages, leading up to each 2 second CGI clip of the characters being eaten by the shark one by one. In some cases I can really enjoy a film with bad acting and low budget filmmaking, and if I think it's worth recommending then I might even give it a high rating. This is not the case here. I don't regret seeing it, but I can't recommend it or claim is was good in any way.",
    "spoiler": "The parts I enjoyed the most were the axe attack, when one character declared themselves human trash and acted as bait for the shark, and when that other guy slid down the slide on the back of the boat on their way to rescue him.",
