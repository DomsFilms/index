    "review": "Is this film turning into a cult classic over time? It seems like sentiment for Prometheus is growing as more Alien films are released about the alien chasing people around a space ship. This is the one film in the series that actually introduces interesting new lore and expands the universe, rather than just trying to replicate the success of the original. It's still really flawed, but it is beautiful and fun, and I've increased its rating since last time. If only they ran to the side; that could have been worth an entire extra rating point.",
    "spoiler": "The other kick in the teeth right at the end is the cheesy voiceover, setting up an optimistic franchise sequel that never happened, and which doesn't match the tone of the rest of the movie. She sets off for a new adventure like it's a Back to the Future movie!",
