	"review": "My one word summary for this is \"primal\", not necessarily because the native american culture was that primative, but because of the primal nature of hunting and being hunted. It's like an exploration of what it means to not be at the top of the food chain. The predator sees a wolf charsing a hare, and chooses to hunt the wolf. Then it sees a bear chasing a dog, and chooses to hunt the bear. Hunting prey without the intention of eating it is quite a human thing, and so once it reaches humans things become more complex. It does come accross as a bit of a simple creature when we realise it just goes after whatever animal is posing the highest threat. It made me think that it could easily be tricked, like it could get stuck in a loop of hunting praying mantises as it watches them kill each other. If the predator can hunt everything else, why doesn't it choose to hunt other predators? Anyway it's ok, entertaining at the time, but maybe not memorable.",
