	"review": "I thought this started off with a poor opening scene, slowly got better and more exciting throughout, but then shat the bed in the third act. The most memorable and grotesque part is part way through, and is largely unrelated to the rest of the plot. The ending doesn't live up to that moment. It was a real letdown, and is cynically engineered to kick off another tedious franchise. It relied on some CGI for the most striking visuals, which was disappointing.",
