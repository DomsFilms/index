There's a plucky band of survivors trapped in a hospital full of horrors, and they're visited by an irrational republican and his mute friend who make everything more frustrating. There are cultists outside but they weren't much more than a plot device to stop the gang from leaving. I was a little let down by the ending. I've thought about whether this should be a 9 or 10 on the grotesque scale. It has lots of gross monsters, but they don't look much like people. You don't see much damage done to healthy people, so I can't really identify with the gore.",
    "spoilers": "For example, we could have seen someone's fingers get broken with a hammer, but we don't. We could have seen a man hack away at his wife with an axe, but it happens behind frosted glass. We could have seen a C-section, but we didn't. So it's highly grotesque, but it could have been even grotesquer.",
