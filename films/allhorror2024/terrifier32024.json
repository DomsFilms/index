	"review": "It's kind of the same as {Terrifier 2}, but it gives you some fresh kills to enjoy. Sienna is better this time around, but ultimately I don't care about any of the characters, and knew how they'd all end up apart from her and her brother. Once again, most of the plot is about how some people know thre's a killer coming for them, and others don't. The characters with the information are incapable of communicating the threat. Despite living together, Sienna spends a whole evening in the house without explaining that she saw the person who killed her mother, in a shopping mall minutes before a mass killing occurred in that exact spot. Nobody listens to her and she doesn't phrase it in a way that makes sense, so it plays out like the big misunderstanding trope in every sitcom. I guess I liked how it acknowledges the trauma and unwanted fame of surviving a horror movie situation, like in {Scream 2}. Once again I loved Art and wished he was in a better story.",
