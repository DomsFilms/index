    "review": "It's the typical <i>Evil Dead</i> format: people trapped in a small residential space, suffering increasingly bloody and improbable injuries. It's a bit of a collection of disparate slasher gore scenes without much story. I really liked the condemned art deco building setting, although in the end it functions very similarly to a log cabin. I was worried when CGI bugs swarm around an actor thrashing at the air, near the start. It's a very cheesy effect. But when the blood started spraying, it looked real enough. It makes me think I need to reassess the dynamic range of the grotesque rating, because I've been giving out a lot of 10s recently.",
