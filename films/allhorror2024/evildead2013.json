Is it boring for people who know what is going to happen the whole time? Yes. I don't dislike it, but I would never recommend it when you could watch {Evil Dead II} instead and have so much more fun. This reboot really lacks personality and quirkiness in comparison. I particularly didn't like the attempt at emotional impact towards the end, but the rest of the last act was fun. It is extremely violent, but I can't give it a perfect grotesque score when there is so much obvious CGI. It just doesn't feel as horrible when it looks so fake.",
