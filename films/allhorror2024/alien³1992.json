	"review": "I'd always avoided seeing this because I'd heard it was bad, but I found it had plenty of redeeming features. There's cool worldbuilding, sets and a good score. I liked Charles Dance's character writing and performance. The whole first half was pretty good, but there was no payoff later on. The CGI was disappointing and the credits font at the end was a shockingly bad choice. It starts so strong and ends up so dull.",
