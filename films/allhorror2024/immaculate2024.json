	"review": "This is a very similar plot to The First Omen, so it's interesting that they were released at the same time by different studios. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films\">There are a lot of examples of this here.</a> I thought this one was much better because it's not trying to be part of a series; it's a fun self-contained story that has just the right amount of suspense and wackiness. I have given it a 10 in the grotesque category not because of its quantity of gory scenes, but because it had some really memorable visuals, including a part that made me hide behind a pillow because it triggered a body horror ick, and another part that made me say \"oh shiiii\" out loud in the room on my own.",
	"spoilers": "I'm writing this spoiler bit a long time afterwards and it wasn't as memorable as I thought it would be, but I think the body horror ick was losing fingernails or toenails. And the \"oh shiiii\" moment was the reveal of the rock at the end.",
