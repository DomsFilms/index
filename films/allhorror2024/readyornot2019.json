	"review": "The premise is just too silly. Too much effort is spent unsuccessfully convincing us why the game takes place and why the characters want to play it. It's quite well made but it can't escape this conceptual flaw. The characters have to repeatedly state their motivations out loud, because the whole story hinges on them, and they're not implicitly obvious. Get Out is far better. People in this film <i>splat</i>, and you'll see what I mean if you watch it.",
