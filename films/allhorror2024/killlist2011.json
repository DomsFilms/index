    "spoilers": "...when it takes a wild turn towards folk horror and then ends abruptly without giving any sort of resolution. Premature horror endings can be judged easily based on how you think about them afterwards: If it leaves you thinking about what it could mean or what happened to the characters next, then it was a good ending. If it leaves you thinking about why the filmmakers chose to end it that way, then it was a bad ending. (E.g. budget constraints or a failed ending left on the cutting room floor.) In this case, the lack of info and the ending really worked for me. It can't have just been revenge or sport, as the cultists were willing to sacrifice themselves running into gunfire. They must have believed in some spiritual calling revolving around raisin man. But as the HR lady said, it's probably nothing personal. And did he almost break into a Midsommar-like smile at the end, or was it pure shock and bewilderment?",
