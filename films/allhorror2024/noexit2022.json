	"review": "This movie has no chill at all. It's all pickle after quandary after conundrum. There are twists comin' atcha so fast you don't have any time to relax and survey the situation. It's the Hateful Eight with ADHD and it does suffer from going too hard too fast, rather than ratcheting up the tension. As a result its suspense rating comes from the sheer quantity as opposed to the quality. It's funny in its absurdity. Just imagine trying to explain the plot to someone.",
