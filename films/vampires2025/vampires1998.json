    "review": "This was 1998!? It is dripping with 80s cheese. There's very little emotional or subtextual complexity; it's just about some dudes trying their darndest to kill vampires. Laura Palmer is in it with an increasingly intense and funny performance. The soundtrack was made by director John Carpenter, similar to <i>They Live</i>, but the music is more interesting here. However, the rest of the movie is really quite boring; it's just so incredibly shallow.",
