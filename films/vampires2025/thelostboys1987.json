    "review": "I'm not sure if Corey Haim was a good actor, but he was certainly in a lot of a certain type of movie that I like. I have never been to California but I like living vicariously through movies about hanging out on the boardwalk, exploring the city on warm nights, and cruising on Route 1. This movie starts very promisingly, but ultimately the story didn't go anywhere interesting for me. It was quite funny, not in the story, but in the characterisation. I liked the old hippie grandpa, the frog brothers, and Alex Winter looking funny while having no lines. When vampires are depicted as a modern day counterculture movement, like punks, they don't usually have all the classic tropes. They usually make it seem like the classic superstitions are old-fashioned and don't apply to modern day vampires, except for maybe staking through the heart as a way to introduce some cool violence. IAnd yet in this movie they do most of the big ones, in an incongruous way. It might be because they couldn't come up with any interesting character development and had to fall back on the usual props and visual gags.",
