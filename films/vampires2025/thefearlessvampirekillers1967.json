    "review": "Roman Polanski spends this movie dressed as Austin Powers. It's full of dated 60s jokes about women and foreigners, and obviously we all hate Roman now, but I have to admit it's a decent movie. The sets and worldbuilding are really cool for a comedy. Not many of the jokes landed with me, but I like watching old comedies to learn about what tickled people back then.",
