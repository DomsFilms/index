    "review": "I loved it. It oozes style and has a really cool setting. The stage plays are amazing. Young Kirsten Dunst is great, and her relationship to Tom and Brad is very interesting. I didn't think they used the interview format to it's full potential, but the historic story is good enough to keep you interested. I liked how they focused on the sadness of living at night, not seeing the colour of the world in sunlight.",
