    "review": "After about 5 minutes of beautiful and captivating scenes, this takes an enormous nosedive into generic monster survival action. Maybe in 2007 it wasn't so bad, but since then we've been through a wave of apocalyptic zombie survival media and this is a frankly boring early attempt at that type of thing. A band of survivors try to hide from their predators in an empty town, looting supplies, getting picked off one-by-one, making hard choices after someone is bitten, sacrificing themselves to save the rest of the group etc. You could replace the vampires in this with any other monster, notably zombies, and you wouldn't have to change anything else. They're just threatening humanoids the survivors must hide from. It's full of repetitive empty calorie action scenes and if it had a much lower budget, it would be the sort of thing you'd expect to see on the Sci-Fi (formerly SyFy) channel. Why was everyone so busy on the last day of sunlight? Wouldn't that day have had an impractically short period of sunlight anyway? I would have left town sooner.",
