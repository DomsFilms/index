	"review": "I remember deciding to see this when it was new, and it's taken me 10 years to get around to it, just like how these aloof vampires happily let mortal's time flow by without batting an eyelid. Vampire movies often have drug metaphors for their insatiable thirst for blood, but in this case they behave very much like heroin addicts. They loll around thinking about maybe making some post-rock music, but then sleeping instead. They see the sober members of society as though they were ants swarming around unnecessarily busily, achieving nothing more than occasionally inconveniencing their plans to just chill out. Tangier is exactly the right place for them. They even think that hunting and sucking the blood from their victims is very gauche for a 21st century vampire, and the couple really sell the indifference and experience of being ancient patrons of the arts; nothing surprises them once they've seen a few civilisations rise and fall. Basically what I'm trying to say is: the vibes here are perfect. It's not a flawless film, but it appeals so strongly to my tastes that it left me wishing I was a vampire. The perfect gothic hangout movie for me, and mayhap for thee.",
