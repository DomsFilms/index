    "review": "I think <i>Ganja & Hess</i> is the more sophisticated and interesting movie, but I can't deny this one was more entertaining. Mamuwalde is a victim, rather than your typical evil master Dracula. He's eloquent and charming, while cursed with an insatiable desire for blood. In this movie, there is a scene where someone is meant to smash a clay pot over Mamuwalde's head, but after throwing it from 20cm away, his misses and hits an extra in the face instead. And yet they used that take, maybe because they only had one breakable pot prop to use, and cut to a close up of the right guy falling unconscious as if it wasn't obvious! Blacula also knocks out multiple cops by gently hitting them while they're wearing motorcycle helmets, which I couldn't ignore. There are multiple cool musical performances. I liked the ending too.",
