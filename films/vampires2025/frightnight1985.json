    "review": "After watching the remake and having a bad time, I wanted to know what was so good about the original to gain it's cult classic appeal. It's more silly and more fun than the remake, and the vampire does more than just chase everyone around menacingly. This type of story works much more effectively in an 80s B movie comedy horror than a 10s Judd Apatow style raunchy comedy horror. It also has a higher age rating so it is inadvertently more raunchy than the remake anyway. I will probably forget it (except for the very strange performance of Evil Ed), but I had a far better time watching it than the soulless newer version. Could it just be the patina of age that gives this some charm? Will we one day look back fondly on trash from the 2010s?",
