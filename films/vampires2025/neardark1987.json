	"review": "This is why I added a seedy rating for vampire films. I can't imagine the lives of modern vampires getting much seedier than this. I thought the vampire costumes looked cool, but the rest of the movie looked a bit dark and plain. It's a series of fight scenes without much plot stringing them together, and there is some terrible child acting on display, but I can't deny the movie has at last a little charm. Imagine {Road House}, but with vampires. There's a cut in this, between two scenes where the lighting is similar and the interior paint colour is the same, where you might not immediately realise they've changed location. As a result, I thought for a moment the town sheriff had an office desk in a girl's bedroom.",
