    "review": "I like the characters and it has some unique ideas, but ultimately it's not that thought-provoking or riveting. It's a morose drama about vampiric depression without any emotional connections to be made to the characters. Saoirse Ronan is great in it, playing her usual poetic ethereal role. Tom Hollander is another reliably good actor, playing his usual slimy guy who always gets his comeuppance role. There are some other interesting personalities too, but they just don't quite do anything to earn a higher rating.",
