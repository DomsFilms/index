I don't like it when these reviews read like sporadic thoughts, each represented by one setnence, but here are some of those. Seeing {The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are in My Neck} recently made me think about all the specific sets and plot beats that match the original {Nosferatu}. The part where Orlok appears to teleport around the room magically while serving wine and reading the contract is so cool. If there was more at the tavern in Transylvania I would have eaten it up. The two children are really funny to me. The colour palette is very distinct. When Nicholas Hoult falls into the river it's a surprising piece of physical comedy that would fit right into {Hundreds of Beavers}. There's also a shot of him with his shirt off that is shocking; every muscle in his upper body is so incredibly tense, I thought all cosmetics and prosthetics at first.",
