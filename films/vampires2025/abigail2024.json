    "review": "I found it annoying how cheesy and full of tropes this was. It's got the energy of a streaming service movie aimed at an audience younger than myself, with a gang of different characters who each have to react and quip to each shocking thing that happens; cycling through reaction shots etc. It even has a \"they fly now!?\" moment. There's no subtext or subtlety and it culminates with a bit of a CGI battle scene, like it could have been a darker DC/Marvel movie. It's a bit like <i>Ready or Not</i>, but with fewer original ideas. I will definitely forget everything except the premise.",
