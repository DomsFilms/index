    "review": "More than any other vampire film I've seen, this one explores how the vampire curse comes with an insatiable desire to do evil, and how the host's ability to suppress it depends on their integrity and righteousness. In many ways it is about this self-control for sin avoidance. Its a long an emotionally complex drama that I really enjoyed, with some cool effects and stunts. There's a scene in this where a vampire throws a corpse like how Mario throws Bowser.",
