	"review": "Another triumph of elevated horror from Robert Eggers. This film didn't leave me with much to think about afterwards, but the experience of watching it is incredible. The colour, and lack thereof, really stood out to me. It just has this amazing visual style, especially during the first part with more natural landscapes. That first part in Transylvania is so exciting that it might feel a bit like it has slowed down afterwards, but the finale is also amazing. I wish the dancing locals part went on for a bit longer. The dialogue and acting are a bit melodramatic and theatrical in the best way possible. At the start there is a scene with surprising number of vampire metaphors, which comes across as being slightly cheesy, but in hindsight it was nice to ease into the film with a bit of levity. As the story becomes more serious and the threat of Nosferatu draws closer, the intensity and poetry ramps up. This will end up as a timeless classic along with {The Lighthouse}.",
