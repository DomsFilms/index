	"review": "In every individual aspect, this game is terrible. It is full of bugs, essentially unfinished, and has a noticeable change of budget and detail between different parts of the game. The voice acting is sometimes terrible, the animations are sometimes terrible. I can't think of one technical aspect to praise. The original and licensed music is a decent selection but the mixing is so inconsistent and the areas with diegetic music are so underpopulated, that it's not nearly as effective as it should be. Gameplay-wise the stealth, combat, puzzles and exploration are a disaster. Having said all this, the game is one of the finest examples of a product that is <i>more than the sum of its parts</i>. I really liked it because of the general seedy vibe, and the nostalgic fashion and language. The narrative ambition is a high point, even if it's not always particularly well executed. There are small side quests in this game that try to tell a more interesting story than a lot of these vampire movies I've been watching. It's so full of interesting but failed ideas and QA issues that if you told me it was made in Eastern Europe I'd have believed you. It's a lot like {S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl} or {The Witcher} (one) in this regard: angsty eurojank.",
