    "review": "This is a really long, slow and deliberate ghost story anthology. It looks amazing for 1964, probably because it's filmed on slylised sets, with fake snow and painted skies. Location filming looked noticably worse back then. The score is that kind of minimalist japanese music, and there's a great traditional narrative song during the intermission that introduces the backstory for the next segment. I was amazed by how well it has aged and how enjoyable it was, but I could only recommend it to patient and serious movie fans.",
