    "review": "This is much more of an offbeat comedy than I expected. I am not sure if everything I thought was funny about it was an intentional joke, and I found it very endearing generally. I love human-monster transformation scenes with practical effects, and any werewolf movie worth it's salt should have one. The transformation is great here. One last thing: in my notes I wrote that Alex wears what looked like a really nice cozy woolly jumper.",
