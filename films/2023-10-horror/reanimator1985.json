    "review": "This is a comedy with dry humour and no explicit punchlines. It's not too different from an unintentionally funny low budget B movie. For example: zombies usually shuffle around in a wobbly fashion, and the joke in this film is that the wobbliness is slightly exaggerated. Having said that, it becomes compeletely outrageous in the last 20 minutes or so, which is very fun. There are some scenes that must have been a totally bizarre day of filming. There is also a sort of recurring joke about things getting thrown against the back wall of the set that I liked.",
