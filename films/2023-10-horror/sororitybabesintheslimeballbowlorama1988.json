    "review": "This is a terrible comedic B movie on a similar level to <i>Troll 2</i>, and it's self-aware about how terrible it is. The characters mock the premise of breaking into a bowling alley for no reason, and one of them gets some shit for being called Taffy. Another character called Spider has one of the worst acting performances I've seen this month. If you like bad movies then you might get a laugh out of it, but they way it makes fun of itself took away some of my enjoyment, compared to disasters that appear more earnest, like <i>The Room</i> or <i>Vampire's Kiss</i>.",
