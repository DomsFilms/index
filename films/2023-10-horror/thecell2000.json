    "review": "This film has a series of really imaginative dream sequences, but they're tied together by an underwhelming detective story that is clearly a lazy attempt at copying <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> and <i>Se7en</i>. This is kind of like a David Cronenberg film in that it's all about the concept, with an unsatisfying script full of unanswered questions. Neither Vince Vaughn or J.Lo are very interesting in this, almost like they're too calm and professional.",
