    "review": "This is the first Kenneth Branagh Poirot movie I've seen and it's convinced me to see the others. I didn't know plot of this one in advance so I was on the hook for the mystery all the way through. It's a fairly good looking film with so many Dutch angles than I started to find each one funny towards the end. There are some jump scares which worked well in the cinema, especially as I wasn't expecting any from this cosy Poirot story. Kenneth Branagh's face barely moves in this; he's very restrained compared to Tina Fey who is going ham as the quirky sidekick. At first I found this dichotomy annoying but by the end I'd heard enough good jokes from her character that she'd won me over, and you can't not like Poirot himself.",
