    "review": "It's probably not for everyone but I love it. A totally imaginitive and wacky collection full of jokes about horror tropes, comedic gore, and '99 nostalgia. Every part was highly entertaining and at least a little scary. The most intense story is at the end, unlike <i>V/H/S/94</i> which petered out a little. It's hard to choose a favourite part.",
