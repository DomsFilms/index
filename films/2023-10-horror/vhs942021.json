    "review": "I should watch more anthology horror films. Short stories can get right to the good parts without any of that boring scene setting and character building. The first two parts of this are genuinely scary, and the rest are interesting and well made. Watching it on a streaming service is awkward because it has analogue VHS noise and digital compression artefacts combined. There's one story here that could be straight out of Love Death + Robots, and it was my favourite part, although it wasn't one of the scary ones.",
