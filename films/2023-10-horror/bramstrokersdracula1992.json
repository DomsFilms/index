    "review": "An astonishing melodramatic interpretation, where the acting, costumes and camp are right at the limit of respectability. It's highly entertaining, but hard to follow if you don't know the plot of the novel beforehand. The accents are atrocious, but I am not sure if that was due to stylistic choice.",
