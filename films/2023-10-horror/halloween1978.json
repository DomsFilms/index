    "review": "This film is somehow enjoyable and kind of mesmerising, despite being technically bad in some key aspects. The acting is consistently terrible and every line seems like a result of amateurish line reading. There are lots of telephone calls where it sounds like the two sides were recorded separately and edited with awkward pauses, and the in person conversations aren't much better. The geography of the film is baffling because every street is generic american suburbia and every house looks the same. So much of the film is spent with characters walking between similar houses, hanging around in hallways in those houses, and calling each other to discuss which houses they are in. The best scene is when our hero Mr Myers is stabbing through the cupboard doors, and the worst scene is the opening when he stabs his sister. That has got to be some of the least enthusiastic being stabbed acting I've ever seen. The music and filmography are doing a lot of work here to elevate it to a classic.",
