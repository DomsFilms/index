Silent films can be inherrently boring if you're not in the mood for them, but if I ignore that issue and judge it compared to the others I've seen, it's easily the best. The story made more sense to me than Caligari, and it's genuinely spooky if not scary. I saw the Criterion release with the Matti Bye score, which was great.",
