    "review": "Nic Cage is a good actor. He has a particular style which some people mistake for being bad, but at this point in his career he is cast specifically to act that way, and nobody else can do it quite like he can. The best parts of this are when he is on the screen, and the rest is an inoffensive (except for the gore) action comedy. I laughed at Cage several times, but rarely at the other characters. I think that was a problem with the script and not the performances though; the cast are all competent. It's like an Edgar Wright film, but your least favourite of his films is better than this.",
