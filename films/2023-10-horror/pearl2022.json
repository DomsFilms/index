    "review": "As a certified A24 bro I wasn't expecting anything less than stellar, and I was not disappointed. Some scenes in this really made my skin crawl. It's executed so well that I couldn't possibly suggest any changes, but I don't think I can give it a 10 because I can't see myself wanting to see it again any time soon. By design the plot is simple, similar to <i>X</i> and <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i>, and not full of details and complexity to contemplate over multiple viewings. The films I rate subjectively as 10s are usually more rewarding to rewatch than this one.",
