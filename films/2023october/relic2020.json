    "review": "This is nicely made but kind of disappointing. I was hoping it would be scarier and have a more shocking ending. The bit with the evil antihouse was cool, but the rest was forgettable. I guess dementia isn't that scary to me, or I need a more realistic film to respond to the threat of a real illness."
