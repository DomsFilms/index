    "review": "I like so-bad-they're-good movies and cheesy B movies, but i've seen all the well-known ones and was scraping the barrel when I picked this. Luckily it turned out to be very funny. Really awful dialogue, lots of unpredictable plot twists, and an unbelievable low-budget snake prop. It's up there with Hell Comes to Frogtown and They Live.",
