    "review": "It's hard to watch Danny DeVito scurrying around in the sewers and not think it's Frank Reynolds going through some kind of breakdown. Again, I'm no expert, but I thought The Penguin was meant to be a mobster who wore a tuxedo and not a half-man half-seabird who was raised by penguins. It's a very wacky spin on the character. The same can be said for Catwoman, who is some kind of zombie infused with cat DNA here. The script so cheesy, it's deep in so-bad-it's-good territory but not necessarily that fun to watch. It has a funny Wilhelm scream.",
