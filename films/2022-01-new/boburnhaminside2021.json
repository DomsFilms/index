    "review": "I'm usually not a fan of American stand-up, but musical comedy is more consistent between the UK and USA and I liked this a lot. I thought it was interesting how the gimmick is that he's stuck trying to make content alone in his home with nothing but a camera. It's presented as though this is a unique new style of comedy, but in reality this is what countless YouTubers do for a living regardless of the pandemic. He's definitely aware of the similarities as he parodies YouTube and Twitch content, but doesn't explicitly mention those sites. This is much better than your typical comedy vlog content, due to being made by a professional at work for a year, without the pressure to upload every week. It's more visually engaging than a stand-up show because his lighting and framing is so good, and it seems like he can fit more topics in by cutting abrubtly between them, rather than trying to transition smoothly during a live monologue.",
