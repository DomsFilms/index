    "review": "This is surely a Marmite kind of film. The people for whom it doesn't click will really hate it. I liked it's adventerous design, and I bet it would be great to watch in the middle of the night with all the windows open. Despite being fuzzy and muffled, I think this deserves to be seen on a very high fidelity entertainment setup.",
