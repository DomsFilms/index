    "review": "I might have seen this as a child, as I remember certain parts. I know the story from other adaptations. In general I was disappointed by it. It's not as good as the excellent subsequent Disney films: The Sword in the Stone, The Jungle Book and The Aristocats. The songs aren't as memorable and it has to jump between scenes too quickly to fit the story in to it's short running time. It's also quite racist towards the \"Indians of Never Land\".",
