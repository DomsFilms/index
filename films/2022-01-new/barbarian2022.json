    "review": "This is a well executed, but generic spooky basement horror movie. It's got the crazy multi-generational family, cursed house that everyone in the neighbourhood knows about, monster that you only catch glimses of. It's like that one really scary episode of the X-Files. There were a few moments I loved, but I get the feeling this will blend in with a lot of other horror movies in my memory, given a few years.<details><summary>spoilers</summary>The first section, before the introduction of Justin Long, is amazing on it's own as a short film. It gets a lot sillier after that.</details>",
