    "review": "This was fun to see in the cinema, but I never want to see it again. The first act was enjoyable as we get to see the characters talking to each other and having personalities. Then there's a really long section set in Barcelona which was like a poor man's Indiana Jones. At that point we stopped getting to know the characters as they only talked about whatever action was happening on screen and no longer had real conversations. After that it's all crazy CGI, action and yelling until the end. It didn't take itself too seriously and had a few decent jokes, but it also didn't try to evoke any kind of emotions or make you think at all. Just a big dumb action movie where you might occasionally exhale through your nose when the quips land just right. Like National Treasure but more self-aware.",
