    "review": "I thought this would have aged badly but it was actually great. The first half of the film is the part that's been copied by so many other monster and disaster movies since, where an escalating threat raised by scientists is ignored by some business tycoon. Because I've seen that formula many times it was a little boring to watch. The second half, on the boat, was fantastic and unique. I was very pleased with this.",
