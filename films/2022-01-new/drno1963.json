    "review": "Firstly: the intro sequence was crazy. They used three different songs during the title sequence with jarring transitions. There was also some terrible sound and sound mixing throughout. There must have been other films at the time with realistic looking and sounding gunshots/firefights, but this isn't one of them. The villain gets less screen time than the strange ventilation/water/prison-access pipe. I had assumed this would be good, as it's the first film that spawned the series, but it was actually very low-budget and rough around the edges. The second Bond film, From Russia With Love, was released 12 months later. That one is one of my favourites, so it shows how they quickly used the financial success of this film to improve the series.",
