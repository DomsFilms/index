   "review": "I liked this but there were a few things I wish were different about it. It's beautiful and the music is great. Kubo was my least favourite character, and I didn't like that everyone had American accents. I don't demand that Japanese voice actors were used or anything like that; I just found the voice cast annoying and there was a lot of unnecessary shouting. Charlize Theron was ok in it. It's a children's film, and its jokes are tuned for an audience of children, but I'm not sure if a child would actually like this or find it boring.",
