    "review": "I'd never seen a Kevin Bacon film before the Spookstravaganza. I didn't know much about this one going in, but I saw the director and cast and expected good things. I've seen several films directed by Clint Eastwood and liked them all. I thought this one was great. Very mature and believable story with complex relationships and and an ending that doesn't just wrap everything up with a bow, like some detective dramas.",
