    "review": "I originally gave this a 10, but on a second watch I found that I wasn't that interested in seeing all the segments again. This is the first time I've seen a V/H/S movie twice, and they are very slightly worse when you know what's going to happen. What I really wanted to do was skip the segments I wasn't interested in and just watch <i>Suicide Bid</i>, <i>Ozzy's Dungeon</i> and <i>To Hell and Back</i> again. I really do love it though; I think these are some of the best segments that V/H/S has to offer.",
