	"review": "After a very fast intro, a couple are trapped in limbo and forced to raise a theatre kid, and the only thing on TV is {Hypnotoad}. Horror movies have to have a long and interesting setup if the twist is just that there's a regular old killer. High-concept horror movies can get away with no setup at all if the twist is interesting enough. In this case it works well; they're very efficient at introducing the characters. Some things I liked about this were the sound design and ambient score in the finale, and Martin, who really stole the show for me.",
