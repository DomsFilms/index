	"review": "This is a story about the world's worst house warming gift. Both the statue and the movie are really quite scary. The ending was a little disappointing to me, because the revealed character motivations are a bit hard to understand, and not particularly foreshadowed. Other than that, I liked it and it might end up being one of the scariest movies of 2024. I would definitely watch a TV show about Darcy and her haunted trinket shop.",
