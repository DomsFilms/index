	"review": "The way they became trapped in this situation was a little contrived, but once the stakes were set, I was invested. Sometimes characters in a horror/crime situations make the worst decisions, and dig themselves into ever-deeper holes. In this film they did all the right things, and survived far longer than I would have. I felt like I was part of the group planning session while they assessed their options. The chaos of using guns in a panic without any training was captured really well. As a whole it was just so engrossing.",
