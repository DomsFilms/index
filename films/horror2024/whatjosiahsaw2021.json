	"review": "It's a bit long, but it does contain multiple chapters that tie together in a satisfying way without ever feeling boring. It's a sad tale of family trauma similar to {True Detective Season One}. It's not so much of a horror film as a dark drama, but there are one or two scenes that are upsetting enough to justify its inclusion in my horror marathon. At one point a character wears a sheepskin jacket that makes him look like Leon S. Kennedy.",
