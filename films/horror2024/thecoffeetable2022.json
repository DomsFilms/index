    "review": "This is extremely horrible and stressful. It's a black comedy but in the darkest possible way. It's Vantablackâ„¢. No light can escape once you pass the event horizon about 20 minutes in. Although there's not much horror, the realism and the character's reactions really make it relateable, earning the highest possible grotesque rating with the way it made me react physically. I found it harder to watch than some of the hardest Black Mirror episodes. I feel sorry for anyone who watches it and I'm disturbed by the people who wrote it. It {is} funny though.",
