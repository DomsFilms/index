	"review": "This is not much of a horror film, but it does contain some horrifying violence, and situations I would definitely not want to find myself in. It's gritty and has some unique character interactions. The acts of violence are grotesque in nature, but not as visceral in presentation as a typical horror movie. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but it did show me some things I have never seen in a movie and might never see again, and there is value in that.",
