    "review": "This movie has a very 90s style score, a load of ticking beige computers, and a scene where a guy struggles to read a paper manual on how to connect to the internet for the first time. He asks for help on saving the address of a website, and when told to click on the bookmark option, he finds a notepad and pen and starts writing down \"click...\" It's a decent ghost story with creepy spectral encounters. The visual style was great. At the expense of sounding pretentious I was reminded of Wong Kar-wai films, really nicely filmed stylishly dressed characters making connections in a lonely East Asian concrete jungle. I was disappointed with the low energy ending, which was conceptually interesting but not very dramatic.",
    "spoilers": "Towards the end, ghosts invade the world of the living, arriving through the internet. The ghosts win and much of the world's living population vanishes or dies. But it's not as exciting as it sounds.",
