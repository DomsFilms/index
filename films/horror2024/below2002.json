	"review": "This has expensive looking sets and effects, but soap opera quality dialogue and acting. I was really disappointed. It was intended as a thriller, adapted into a horror, then distributor asked for a re-edit to lower the age rating, and limited its release when the director refused. You can really feel this lack of direction and purpose. There are generally spooky scenes that don't serve any plot purpose, the resolution is confusing and unsatisfying. I didn't particularly notice any symbolism or themes. It's just some bad stuff that happens on a submarine, and also the submarine is haunted. The dialogue especially didn't sell me on the idea this was taking place in the 1940s. It's like a sci-fi TV movie.",
