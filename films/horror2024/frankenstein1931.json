    "review": "It looks great for its age, with impressive sets and a consistent look for the on location scenes. It shies away from showing anything too shocking, like brains or murders (they cut away quickly), except for the end where it's quite upsetting to see the monster wail as he becomes trapped. It really is one of the most memorable horror movie monsters, up there with the Xenomorph and Count Dracula. I liked it but the ending wasn't very satisfying. I wanted a speech from the Dr lamenting his creation and tying the themes of the movie together, or something. Instead it ends with an old guy basically saying \"Well, that's that.\"",
