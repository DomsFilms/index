    "review": "I've reviewed this before and I gave it a 5, then bumped it up to a 6. But now I realise it has proven to be very memorable, and I felt like watching it again because it was so entertaining. It's dumb fun inspired by {Alien} (in the natural way the crew chat as they wake up), and {Hellraiser} (in the monster design and lore). There's cool 90s music, effects and costumes. As I said before, the set is really cool, and I love it when a movie is set in one location where you can memorise the layout (E.g. {No Exit, Climax, The Hateful Eight}). In a way this is shallow and a slight waste of the cool demonic sci-fi idea, but I like it and had fun during my second watch. It can take multiple viewings to resonate with cult appeal.",
