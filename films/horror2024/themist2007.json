	"review": "The script in this is kind of like a TV movie, with generic small town archetypes each saying their part while reacting to the latest plot development. In that sense I was really disappointed, but there are some other aspects I liked. The threat was cool, and I always appreciate movies that take big risks like spending the entire runtime in one location, or not revealing exactly what is out there in the mist. The supermarket had an incredible amount of dog food in stock; they must have had an entire aisle with nothing other than that size of dog food bag.",
