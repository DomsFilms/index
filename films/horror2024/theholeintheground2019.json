	"review": "A well made and captivating movie, but without any really memorable ideas or sequences. The hole wasn't as important in the story as I expected, like the same film could be made with cave in the woods, a cranny in the alley, or a shed in the garden. Something that annoyed me about it was the loud violin screeches on every reveal, which I couldn't stop noticing.",
