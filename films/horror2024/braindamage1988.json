	"review": "There's this sassy stop motion animated worm, not unlike The Head from Art Attack, who infects people's brains in comedically heavy handed metaphor for drug addiction. He's great but he's held back a bit by the rather plain human characters; the movie is at his best when he's on screen. This is the previous project from the director of {Frankenhooker}, which leans into the comedy more and is generally more fun.",
