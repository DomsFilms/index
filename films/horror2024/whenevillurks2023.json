	"review": "I love how the presence of the demon is beyond doubt from the start. Most characters acknowledge that there are demons in their world, at at most they refuse to believe a demon has come to their community. It is very grotesque from the start, but not in a particularly believable way. You don't spend any time bonding with the characters before things start to get ugly, and yet, through their reactions to the threat, you feel like you know them well by the end. I liked it a lot, and I like how watching horror movies from around the world can show you different local superstitions and folk tales.",
