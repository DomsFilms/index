    "review": "A masterpiece for the ages. There is a grizzly subplot bubbling up from between the lines, taking over the dark drama of this suffering family. Annie starts to unravel it, as does the viewer, and it only leads to manic desperation as their preconception of fate and free will is shattered. It's a nightmare they're trying to wake up from, but each morning they wake to fresh horrors. The camerawork, like the plot, starts off fairly conventional and then twists and obscures in increasingly strange ways. The final shot doesn't even show the moving character in the scene; after all, they've been working discreetly in the background for years to bring about this climax. Everyone says Toni Collette, but the performances and casting are all phenomenal. There are endless little details and ambiguities to enjoy when watching again, and if you see it enough times it becomes an absurd comedy. In my old review I said Peter's reaction, silently driving home and crawling into bed on autopilot, was brilliant. This time I thought about how that behaviour could also be the result of a spiritual transition, like there's an invisible supporting character who you realise is more prominent, and features in more scenes, the more you think about them. Now having said all that, I do have a couple of notes: there's a cute dog I would have liked to see more of. And who bakes a cake at a teenager's house party? Traditionally you bake the cake {before} the party. This movie is so mysterious and smartly written that I just keep thinking about it. What if the cake {was} already baked? What if the nut-chopper was attending the party and chopping those nuts for a very specific reason? Like Annie, I am going insane.",
