	"review": "It feels like a bit of a shame to give this a 5, because it is provocative and conceptually interesting, but I can't deny that I was a little bored. The locations are all grey apartment blocks and under-decorated white rooms. Visually it couldn't hold my interest outside of the really freaky bits. The director/script is asking a lot of these actors, and I'm not sure they were up to the task. Their mannerisms change wildly, for example the German guy who looks like he's going for a different type of eccentricity in every scene. There are some uncomfortable manic arguments that work well in a horror movie. It's in the boobs and screaming genre.",
