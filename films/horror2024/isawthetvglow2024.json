	"review": "It's {Twin Peaks} but the Black Lodge is inside a VHS recording of {Buffy the Vampire Slayer}. I'm sure they even use the buffy credits font on their show. It's a clever take on derealisation and I still don't know what was real or in the heads of the protagonist(s). There's an unreliable narrator and they receive all their information from a even more unreliable supporting actor. I know this movie is divisive online, but I think if you like Nicolas Winding Refn then you'll enjoy this too. I also think you have to see it in the middle of the night, and more so than other horror movies, it wouldn't hit the same if you're planning to do anything afterwards except sleep in front of the TV.",
