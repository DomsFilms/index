	"review": "There is something very 00s about this movie. It's the supernatural, slightly comedic feel, and the showcase of CGI and effects. Maybe this makes no sense, but I think that if {Bruce Almighty} was a horror movie then it would be somewhat like this. In a way it was like this guy was a character in {Betrayal at House on the Hill} and he just kept drawing event cards in the same room. It had some decent jump scares that weren't at all annoying or repetitive like some darker horror movies.",
