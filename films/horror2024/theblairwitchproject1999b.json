	"review": "I have seen this once before, and I gave it a nine after being really impressed, assuming I might not be as scared or interested if I ever saw it again. This time I loved it even more, and was still scared at the end even though I knew what would happen. I've upgraded its ratings in every category, especially grotesque, because Heather's reaction to the mouth parts present is what really makes it memorable. You can watch Ash chainsaw a medieval zombie's head off with a huge grin on his face, and it's absurd and entertaining, but the very relatable shriek and hyperventilation after finding some minor woodland gore in this movie is just as powerful. It's really one of the scariest movies I've seen. It could happen to any of us.",
