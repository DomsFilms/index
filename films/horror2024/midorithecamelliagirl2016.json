	"review": "This is an adaptation of a manga about a girl who is abused by a bunch of professional freaks, so I chose to watch the newer live action movie, where they use an older actress, rather than the anime which I heard is even more problematic. It has a bit of a Terry Gilliam feel, with an absurdist style, vivid costumes, and a blurring of dreams and reality. The acting is very unnatural, but consistently so throughout the cast, so I am not accusing it of being bad. It appears as though the budget was very low, but then it somehow also has practical effects, CGI, and 2D animated sequences.",
