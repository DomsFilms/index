	"review": "It starts off fast and funny, as you learn about the conceptually entertaining premise and see the characters react to it. But about half way through the jokes really slow down and you are given a load of exposition. It just sort of gets worse towards the end? My one word summary is \"throwaway\", not because you should immediately throw this away, but because it delivers throwaway thrills, one night of entertainment, and you'll never want to see it again. I'm not at all convinced of Alyson Hannigan's acting ability, but she is certainly good at picking memorable roles. There is one funny kill where you see about half a second of a silhouette head being chopped in half. I liked that.",
