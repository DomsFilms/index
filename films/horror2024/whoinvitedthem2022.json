	"review": "Imagine if there was a Hollywood remake of the Hollywood remake of {Speak No Evil}. This is several levels less intense, and I became increasingly frustrated with it towards the end. At one point I was thinking of giving it a 7, and then my opinion slided down the scale smoothly during the last 30 minutes. None of the characters are likeable, and I cringed at some of the forced millenial slang they were using. One guy is intentionally written this way, to seem annoying, but I felt the same about everyone at the party. The ending is like the end of a campfire ghost story you'd tell to children. Is this one of these modern streaming movies designed to be on in the background while you look at your phone? Why isn't there a question mark in the title?",
