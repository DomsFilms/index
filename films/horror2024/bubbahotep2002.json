    "review": "I went into this completely blind and was amazed at how imaginative the premise was. It's like an episode of Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, delivered in a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas style. As a horror film it doesn't end particularly well, because the tension doesn't increase towards the end, but as a comedy drama its great. Everything about Jack/JFK was hilarious.",
    "spoiler": "I liked how you never find out if he was really Elvis, but I'm not sure how I feel about the mummy plot completely failing to come together with the Elvis plot. Wouldn't it have been more satisfying if the trapped souls or lineage of the mummy somehow confirmed his identity? Or if there was just some piece of information that connected them?",
