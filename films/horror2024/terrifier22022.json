	"review": "Art the Clown is a great horror character, but here he's trapped in a movie that doesn't make the best use of him. He's funny and genuinely clownish, and it's extremely gory when he goes about his business. He doesn't have to say a word, and it's only the speaking characters I have a problem with. Nothing of interest happens in the plot; none of the other characters are unique in any way. If you have ever seen a movie or TV show where a child experiences something supernatural and their parents don't believe them, then you have heard every line of the mother character's dialogue before. It's like a soap opera that doesn't go anywhere or develop any of the characters, used as filler to justify a series of clown mayhem vignettes. I'm disappointed to hear that some of these characters will be returning in the next one, because if Art could just move to a suburb I cared about, it would solve most of the movie's problems. One other thing to mention: It's weirdly beautifully lit and filmed.",
