    "review": "The shot selection is great, but the cameras used were very early and low-resolution digital ones, so it looks horrible on modern TVs. It's hard to get over how time has ravaged this classic, in a way we don't really have to worry about when shooting on film. Maybe the high-res digital content of today will suffer the same fate in 20 years when we're all watching 16K TVs. Anyway the music is great, there are some fun appearances by actors who went on to become famous, and the story holds up despite the vast amount of zombie stories we've been subjected to in the 00s. They make a good point about how valium would be so valuable in the apocalypse, but totally unwise to use.",
