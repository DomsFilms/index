    "review": "I've reviewed this before, but I felt like watching it again because it's so entertaining. It's dumb fun inspired by <i>Alien</i> (in the natural way the crew chat as they wake up), and <i>Hellraiser</i> (in the monster design and lore). There's cool 90s music, effects and costumes. The set is really cool, and I love it when a movie is set in one location where you can memorise the layout (E.g. <i>No Exit, Climax, The Hateful Eight</i>). In a way this is shallow and a slight waste of the cool demonic sci-fi idea, but I like it and had fun during my second watch.",
