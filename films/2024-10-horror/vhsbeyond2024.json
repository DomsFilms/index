    "review": "This is incredibly fun. They've used their increasing budget to make the V/H/S movies more exciting and watchable, instead of more trying to grow more complex and serious. They dispensed with the story/justification for the shorts and just allow horror directors to experiment with fun ideas for 20 minutes at a time. I liked every segment, and it starts off incredibly strong. Unfortunately CGI aliens aren't as fun to watch as practical puppet aliens. I don't think it really deserves a 10, but I saw it with just the right group of friends to have a 10/10 experience.",
