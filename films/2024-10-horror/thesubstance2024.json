    "review": "Demi Moore's performance is great, and I generally really enjoyed it. My one gripe is that it felt way too long: 140 minutes is a lot for a horror movie with one storyline and not many characters or locations. The world even felt shallow and simple, by design, as her life as a TV star comprises of moving back and forth between her apartment and the studio. But that means there aren't enough interesting sets to keep you engaged. Did we really need two roast chicken scenes, and did Sue need to sleep with two guys? Could it have been shortened and refined into something that doesn't feel like it drags on towards the end? Thankfully there are brilliant flashes of comedy and absurdity to keep you smiling throughout. I really dreaded each time she had to wake Elizabeth up.",
