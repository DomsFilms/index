    "review": "This film is interesting because of the mental state the protagonist is in the whole time. In her grief and confusion she behaves weirdly, is sometimes apathetic, and sometimes has weird mood swings, especially when seeing other people get on with their lives. She is thrust into this situation where she has no idea what to do next; all her plans and aspirations are cancelled. There are some cool looking visual tricks for her ghost, and an interesting story. I did feel like I fully understood the mystery with about 15 minutes left, and it didn't reveal any new surprises at the end. But the ending is maybe intentionally low-key. Death is waiting for us all, regardless of our story or how well we can resist it!",
