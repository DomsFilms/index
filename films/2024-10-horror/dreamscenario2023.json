    "review": "This isn't really a horror movie, but it has some shocks and grotesque scenes. Nightmares are horror. I found the first half of this really exciting when Nic Cage was discovering what kind of strange film he was in, and learning the rules of his dream cameos. The second half turns into a more intense drama without many more thrills, and the ending is memorable without any hint of horror. Another great new Cage performance, near the level of <i>Pig</i>.",
