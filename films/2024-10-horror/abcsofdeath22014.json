    "review": "I think these films are good, if you have the right attitude. It's great for when you have a short attention span, like you're talking through it or it's on in the background. But if you sit through it and pay close attention in a darkened room, it won't have the same effect as other horror movies. It's like watching spooky TikTok shortform content. I'm giving it a higher score than the first one, but that might be because my attitude has changed, rather than the quality of the movie.",
