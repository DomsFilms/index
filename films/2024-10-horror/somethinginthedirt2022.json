    "review": "These two guys write, direct and sometimes star in their own movies together, and I hope they keep doing it, because they love to play with cool sci-fi horror ideas. They don't always nail it, but I always appreciate that horror movies can be home to to these kind of experiments. The presentation is always great on their movies: the filmography, sets, music, posters etc. are all stellar. This movie is really about the relationship between two weird outcasts, and in a way their paranormal experiences are just a plot device for bringing them together. They're both paranoid, and they both think they're on same same wavelengh about their conspiracies. John thinks he's the brains of the operation, but he's a professional wedding photographer who forgot to charge his camera batteries before starting to film his documentary. He's like Walter in The Big Lebowski or Dale in King of the Hill. Levi is the free spirited but generally unsatisfied soul, like Rust from True Detective. He's a bit of a loose cannon, but his chaotic energy is an important part of their dynamic. Ultimately the plot didn't go anywhere particularly interesting in my opinion, and my rating started to slide when I realised that would be the case. But I think the characters themselves will be memorable.",
