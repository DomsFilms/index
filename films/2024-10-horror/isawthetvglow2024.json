    "review": "It's <i>Twin Peaks</i> but the Black Lodge is inside a VHS recording of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>. I'm sure they even use the buffy credits font on their show. It's a clever take on derealisation and I still don't know what was real or in the heads of the protagonist(s). There's an unreliable narrator and they receive all their information from a even more unreliable supporting actor. I think you have to see this in the middle of the night, and mor eso than other horror movies it wouldn't hit the same if you're planning to do anything afterwards except sleep in front of the TV.",
