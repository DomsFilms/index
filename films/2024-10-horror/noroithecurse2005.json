    "review": "Oh dear. I was looking forward to this because it had a cool poster. I like <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> becuase the diagetic photography is part of the story, emphasising how isolated they were. In this found footage movie, it didn't really need to be so shaky and low quality. We could have just followed the main character, a supernatural investigator, with normal film cameras. It could have been a more professional looking documentary style. They do very little with the idea that the cameraman is in the scene, and at the end they're just shaking it around annoyingly and screaming. To me this didn't do anything new or clever with the format, and so much of it was about uninteresting unexplained events. When I put food in my fridge, it sometimes gets hot! When I go to sleep, someone flips over all my coasters! It is not very engaging to hear these people get interviewed. The school classroom bit with the clairvoyant children reminded me of watching <i>Gaki no Tsukai</i>.",
