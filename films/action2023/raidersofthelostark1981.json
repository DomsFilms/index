	"review": "Why does this deserve a 10 when {Aliens} and {Terminator 2} both get 9? One reason is that there's more to the plot here, and more variation in pacing. There are elements of romance and revenge, and also a conflict between Indy and his government. These all add depth that is maybe lacking in the other films. The soundtrack is also perfect here, while it's merely great in those other action classics. I love when Indy says \"I'm making this up as I go along\", and then they immediately cut to him bursting out of a tent on the back of a white horse.",
