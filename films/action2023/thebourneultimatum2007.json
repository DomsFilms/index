	"review": "It starts to get cheesy in this third one as it strays farther from the minimalist nature of the original. There's more prominent swoosh sounds as they throw punches and kicks, I heard some other goofy sound effects, and the script is far less subtle. The photography is improved and the ante is upped sufficiently, not jumping the shark but staying engaging. The rooftop parkour chase scene is particularly bombastic. I like the casting and performances throughout the trilogy. I haven't seen any more of these and it seems like a greedy move to keep the IP going.",
