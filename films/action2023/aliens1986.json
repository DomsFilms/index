    "review": "Another Jim Cam classic, but I prefer {Alien}. Just like {Terminator 2} it's an amazing spectacle but the plot is one dimensional; escape from the aliens instead of escape from the robot. Like {Alien} you first see the crew behaving like real humans, rather than getting any sort of explicit introduction to each character. Did this movie invent the auto-turret that is in so many videogames? I've definitely heard quotes from this movie in several games.",
