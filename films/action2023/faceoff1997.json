    "review": "I'm not much of a John Woo fan and I don't think this is any good. I found myself a bit bored of John Travolta and wanted to see more of Cage. I especially wanted to see more of Cage as the bad guy, the most interesting face-character pairing. There were too many sitcom style misunderstanding scenes, not quite enough action. Some more licensed music, like a Tarantino movie, could have improved this a lot. A better haircut for Cage is also required.",
