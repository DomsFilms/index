	"review": "I saw a remastered version and I was amazed at how good it looks for its age; it could be brand new. It's a great example of a minimal script with an emphasis on visual storytelling. I last saw this when I was 10, and what I remember most is how Arnie cocked his shotgun by spinning it around. That was a big deal for 10 year olds. I don't think there are many 10/10 action films for me, but this is so close.",
