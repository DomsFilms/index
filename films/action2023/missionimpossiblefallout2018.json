	"review": "Simon Pegg spends a lot of this film yelling at an iPad. Henry Cavill's performance is strange: he's very blas√© about everything, and somehow reminded me of Jaws from James Bond. He's a very serious character in a film where everyone else is having a bit more fun. Amazing movie; they're nailing the M:I formula now and they know it.",
