	"review": "I like how this film has a stripped down cat and mouse chase story. It's all about the chase, without too many twists or unnecessary complexities. It was a hit because of how real it made the hand-to-hand fight scenes and car chases, with close shakey cameras and the characters pushed to their realistic physical limits. This set the film apart from the crazy cartoonish action of the 80s and 90s, and ushered in an age of dark, gritty and realistic thrillers. Cool soundtrack with Oakenfold and Moby, but they also know when not to use music.",
