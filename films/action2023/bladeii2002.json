A self-contained story where you already know the deal, just seeing the same characters face a new threat with a new configuration of allies. The monster design is really cool, but in many ways the movie sucks. They spend way too long fighting in the sewers and the plot isn't really complex enough to fill the runtime. There are some hand-to-hand fights that use heavy CGI, giving them a unique look, but I'd much rather see some wire fu instead.",
