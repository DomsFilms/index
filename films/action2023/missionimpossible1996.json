	"review": "This is the only film I can think of that features Usenet, through a very funny fake UI. The opening 30 minutes of this film are confusing, but you can still enjoy it without understanding the story completely. I heard that the writing team, which included Cruise, were still working on it as it was being shot, so the convoluted story and lack of strong motivations is understandable if that's true. It's one of those movies that set a lot of trends, and when you see it now you have to remind yourself it didn't seem so full of tropes when it was new. I remember thinking it was very scary as a kid when the guy dies on the elevator.",
