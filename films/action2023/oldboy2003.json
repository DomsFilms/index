    "review": "Bombastic filmmaking rather than bombastic action, although there are a couple of great fight scenes. I found this gripping although the ending didn't leave me very satisfied. The entire story is about finding out the character's motivations, and when I learned the truth I couldn't quite believe their actions as a response.",
