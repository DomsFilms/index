    "review": "The poster/VHS cover for this movie is comically bad, and Blade looks like a 1998 videogame character in it. Despite being total nonsense, Mr Blade delivers exposition with such an authoritative tone that you can just about get swept up in it, hence the believability rating. There's cool music, and just like {The Matrix} it has people choosing to wear sick leather trenchcoats to nightclubs.",
