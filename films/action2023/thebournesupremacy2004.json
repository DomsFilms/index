	"review": "This film trades away the purity of the first one for a more involved and emotional story, and it was a smart move. The CIA characaters get more lines and a more complex conspiracy story is added that give us something else to think about rather than just the chases and identity mystery. It starts with a shocking character death to reverse any cheesy happily-ever-after sentiment from the end of the first film. It tells us more about Bourne's past without feeling like there have been expository scenes jammed in just for the fans. The final confrontation scene is an amazing idea. James bond never goes and apologises to the families of the henchmen he kills. I'm pleased at how much I'm enjoying re-watching these.",
