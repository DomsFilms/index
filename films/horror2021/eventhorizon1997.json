I like the gothic design on the sets and props, except for the core which is just too over-the-top for the more serious first half. The story is space-codswallop and also suffers from distracting unrelated scenes that exist as a vehicle for jump scares. Laurence Fishburne seems OK in this, but maybe because he doesn't have any of the cheesiest lines. I recommend watching the Beyond the Aquila Rift episode of Love Death + Robots instead and listening to Funky Shit afterwards. (HINDSIGHT EDIT: I've thought about this film a lot since seeing it, and I'm bumping it from five to six because it was fun,)",
