	"review": "I was really absorbed in the story as it's strange and unique mystery unraveled. Nothing particularly scary happens on-screen but it does a great job of making you have a scary thought: that the main characters should choose death over their situation. I can't find the budget for this film online but I guess it was very low, which would make it a real achievement. There is some CGI but it's also got this hand-held camera look and was filmed entirely on location. It introduces new ideas and characters all the way through to drip feed you information, which I liked. It's got some funny dialogue, the main characters reminded me of the McPoyle twins.",
