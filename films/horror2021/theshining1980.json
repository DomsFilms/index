The Steadicam was quite new at the time and Kubrick wanted to use it a lot. You would think that might get annoying or cheesy but the sets are perfectly designed to be fascinating to steadily move through: the different corridors of the hotel and the passages of the hedge maze. There's also a really beautiful shot from high over the hedge maze looking down, just as Jack is looking down at its scale model.",
