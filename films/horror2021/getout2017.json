    "review": "This was refreshing and different after seeing so many films about angry murderers and devils. In this film the real monsters all along were... Microsoft fans. It had a funny script, but I also laughed at the cheesy product placement. You see someone use Bing and at that moment you know they're a total psychopath. This is really good. Bradley Whitford is in some good stuff. The girlfriend in this looks like that obsessed girlfriend meme.",
