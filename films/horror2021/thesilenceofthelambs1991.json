    "review": "Mads Mikkelsen is a good Hannibal but he's not scary - Anthony Hopkins is seriously scary, especially when locked up. The location matters a lot in horror movies: haunted houses can be like characters themselves, towns with dark pasts, claustrophobic spacecraft etc. Hannibal is set in some great atmospheric parts of rural USA in New England and Appalachia. One criticism is that Clarice seems to suddenly reach conclusions out of nowhere, unlike WIll in Manhunter, who's reasoning is more clearly conveyed. I realised while watching this: the less shots fired during a \"shootout\" scene, the more I like them.",
