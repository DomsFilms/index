	"review": "This is a horror film because it has witches in it. The films in this series try to cram in so many characters and side plots from the books and I think they suffer from it. When they were new and everyone was reading the books, it was great to see it all come to life. Now that I don't remember the books so well, I feel like it harms the pacing and prevents them from being timeless classics. If this was an original screenplay it could be better (for adults) by being more focussed on the mystery and peril of the monster. The books get longer and more dour with each instalment so it becomes more of a problem later on. Having said that, it's all so fun that I don't know what I'd cut. All the content keeps the film entertaining for children too, and it makes an excellent slightly dark and scary film for kids. Kenneth Branagh is very memorable in this.",
