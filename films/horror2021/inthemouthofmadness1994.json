    "review": "I found this difficult to follow, as it is told from the perspective of a man during his descent into madness. It's intentional but it does make it a little hard. There are plenty of spooky but unrelated effects. Some fun jump scares. (I find them fun when it's really wacky and unexpected, or the first time you see the monster up close, or if something is hidden in the background and you only jump when you notice it. Some jump scares aren't enjoyable but I don't know how to describe why.) I never knew what this film would throw at me next. The film does a good job of evoking a mood, but maybe not necessarily telling a story.",
