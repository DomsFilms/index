	"review": "More like zero activity. It's the director's first film and it could have been a short film instead without losing anything of value. I struggled to concentrate on it because nothing interesting happened until the last 15 minutes. Maybe if you saw this in the cinema without any expectations and everyone in the screening was tense and silent, then it would have been an exciting event. But seeing it on a TV in 2021 is just not that enjoyable. It's not a bad idea for a movie but I wish it took me on more of an emotional journey or contained a more engaging mystery. I just remembered I saw Paranormal Activity (6): The Ghost Dimension in the cinema and I totally forgot about that experience soon afterwards.",
