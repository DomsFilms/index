    "review": "This looks and sounds great, but it's a bit vapid. I was happy to see this after seeing so many psychological horrors recently. It's good enough for big screen spooking and easy to enjoy without having to concentrate very hard, but you're not going to want to see it more than once. The ending is a little weak compared to the first two main entries in the series.",
