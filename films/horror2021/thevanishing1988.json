	"review": "Starts off slow but gets better and better with an amazing ending. It's also not scary at all until that ending, where it picks up some grotesque points for a conceptually (not visually) gruesome event. The music and the main characters performances were great. The only part of the plot that seemed silly to me was the sneeze. It seemed like such an out-of-character mistake. He struggles socially and messes up when talking to women, but as a chemistry teacher he shouldn't be doing something so foolish in the sneeze scene. My ratings might make this seem mediocre but it's only because it's not so scary and doesn't fulfill the rating categories. It's a good film in general and I'm glad I saw it. ",
