	"review": "My rating system can't cope with this. This film was executed at a 0/10 level but I enjoyed watching it because of how uniquely and amusingly bad it was. So what should the rating be? Am I judging quality or enjoyment? In every category of filmmaking this is an abomination: script, acting, choreography, editing, music, sound effects, sound mixing, CGI and practical effects. It uses random transition effects between shots. There are short clips of footage from the arcade game inserted in the worst places, seemingly as replacements for when a zombie is killed and they didn't catch it very well on film. There's a fight scene that's so long the song they use for it ends and the next one begins afer a moment of silence. When I compare it to other famously bad films: at least it wasn't boring like Battlefield Earth, and there weren't whole scenes shot out of focus like The Room. Some viewers might enjoy this on an ironic level but nobody could sincerely praise the film itself. I've given it a 0 but added some points in the grotesque rating out of pity, because I found the low-budget gore amusing. Fucking hell.",
