	"review": "Due to unforeseen circumstances I watched this again with a group. I enjoyed it for the second time. I paid more attention to the shot framing and the soundtrack, both of which are amazing. It was also fun to look for the evidence of the various theories about the ending and subtext that I've read in the last few days. The kid does a great job. There are some really long dialogue shots so he has to remember a lot of lines and direction.",
