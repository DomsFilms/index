    "review": "Well this is very trashy: It's all sex and gore. I wish they spent more of the film in the hell dimension with the Cenobites. I guess they didn't have the budget to lean into the hell imagery, and didn't have the acting or directorial talent to tap into the psychological trauma of bring forced to commit murder. According to Wikipedia, as one of the actors was filming the scene where he was killed, he \"felt that it made sense for him to do it naked.\" They filmed it but it wasn't used. So now we know that's where they drew the line in terms of taste.",
