    "review": "I'm a big fan of this, especially its visual style. I imagine this is the kind of film Terry Gilliam would make if he wasn't so obsessed with being subversive. It's similar to {Brazil} and {12 Monkeys} so Gilliam would never have done it; he never sticks with something that worked. The sets are great and I can see that {The Matrix} used some identical shots on the same sets, like when the phone rings in an empty room, or the rooftop fight. It was a good idea to set this noir supernatural drama in a city that is perpetually at nighttime, as that is the noirest time of day.",
