    "review": "I'm a big fan of this, especially its visual style. I imagine this is the kind of film Terry Gilliam would make if he wasn't so obsessed with being subversive. It's similar to <i>Brazil</i> and <i>12 Monkeys</i> so Gilliam would never have done it; he never sticks with something that worked. The sets are great and I can see that <i>The Matrix</i> used some identical shots on the same sets, like when the phone rings in an empty room, or the rooftop fight. It was a good idea to set this noir supernatural drama in a city that is perpetually at nighttime, as that is the noirest time of day.",
