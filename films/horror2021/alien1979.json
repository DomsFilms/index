    "review": "Looks amazing for the 70s, with gorgeous lighting and sets. The sound design and soundtrack is great. I like how well it predicts future technology ({2001} is the king of this). The body horror hasn't aged very well and my grotesque rating is unforgiving of outdated unrealistic special effects; they don't evoke the same kind of reaction that they used to. This might be my favourite film ever!",
