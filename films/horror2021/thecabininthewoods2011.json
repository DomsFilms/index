    "review": "This is a very Joss Whedoney film. I know him from Buffy and Firefly, and the the dialogue style really matches those. It gets a lot of bonus points for being unpredictable and completely different to any horror film I've seen before, starting off like The Evil Dead and pulling a crazy bait and switch. It is definitly fun and worth seeing once. Maybe this was a Buffy idea that was too complex and weird to fit into a TV show.",
