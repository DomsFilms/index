	"review": "More interesting than Prometheus. Very impressive visually. They doubled down on Fassbender after his performance in Prometheus. I think one of the things that makes the original Alien so good is its narrow narrative scope. It has more time to show the crew bonding and exploring while building atmosphere, because it doesn't have so much story to tell. All subsequent films in the franchise, including this one, aren't as pure. Also what kind of puny ship takes so much damage from neutrinos?",
