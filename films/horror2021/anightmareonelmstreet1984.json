    "review": "Johnny Depp is unrecognisably youthful in this, his first film. Unfortunately there is little in the way of plot, some atrocious acting, and a kind of lame soundtrack. It's redeemed by some really fun practical effects and it's kind of scary for a teen's slasher. I'm glad I saw it but I can't imagine watching any of its many sequels.",
