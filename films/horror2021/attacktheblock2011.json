	"review": "This is a comedy/action/horror film but it's not that funny/exciting/scary. Some jokes landed well with me but when the action ramped up the jokes stopped. Maybe they should have made the stunts funnier and had some physical comedy, because the action parts are the worst. It's a fun but not very witty or clever. Like a worse version of Shaun of the Dead.",
