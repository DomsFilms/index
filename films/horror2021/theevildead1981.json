	"review": "Puts other low budget 70s and 80s horror to shame. It's a more comedic spin on the slasher formula and indulges in ridiculous violence and spewing fluids. It's got the Raimi absurdity and wacky camerawork in spades. Unfortunately the story isn't very prominent or interesting and you would only want to see it once.",
