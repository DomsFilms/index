    "review": "This is so quiet and slow. A very low-key horror film. I'm not sure how to rate it and think it should have been a bit more exciting. But then again it's set in the wilderness and features an isolated family, so maybe it should be quiet and uneventful. I'm not sure I liked the strange aspect ratio; it made it seem more like a bleak TV show. There are a couple of visually amazing moments and I liked the soundtrack. The scariest part was the game of peek-a-boo near the start.",
