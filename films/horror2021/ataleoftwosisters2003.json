	"review": "To be honest I watched this late at night and sleepily struggled to follow the plot. It's told in a cryptic way so that didn't help. There is one scene with a very scary monster, which was the most memorable part. Other than that I found it to be quite visually boring, as it all takes place in a plain-looking house. The music also sounded like that of a generic 90s romantic drama, with a Korean twist. There were individual scenes I liked but the movie as a whole was mostly a bit of a disappointment.",
