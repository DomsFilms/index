	"review": "Comparing this to {Manhunter} is unavoidable as it's the same story. This has a cast full of stars and they all seem to act quite well but it's a less interesting film generally. {Manhunter} has an endearing 80s cheesiness which makes it less scary but more watchable. This film is essentially losing points because it didn't need to exist and doesn't do anything new.",
