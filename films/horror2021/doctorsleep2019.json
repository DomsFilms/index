    "review": "This is very consistent with the tone of <i>The Shining</i>, although it doesn't have the same dazzling filmography. It has plenty of references to the original and continues Danny's story in a thoughtful way while introducing unique new concepts. In a way it's like an edgy supernatural HBO drama. I didn't have to think too hard and that's ok. I liked it a lot.#sI've since seen the three hour long director's cut of this, and it adds nothing, but slows everything down to let it simmer. The parts that really stuck with my are the child abductions, and digging up the body.#d",
