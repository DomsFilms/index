	"review": "Erie for some different reasons to the rest of this list, and difficult to rate. Count Orlak's costume and movement are the high points, and characters move in an unsettling, stuttering way in silent movies. Everyone who was involved in its production is dead, making the film itself like a creepy old artefact. It's from Germany at a time when the most horrifying thing anyone could imagine was the great war. I watched the blu-ray version so my experience is differnt to other viewers over the last 99 years, because of the way it was restored and the choice of music. (The original soundtrack was \"lost\".)",
