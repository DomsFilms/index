	"review": "This is very pretty and easy to like. You've the mission, the soldiers who get to know each others personalities as they go, the destination which is clearly defined near the start but contains an unknown. The perfect setup for an Apocalypse Now style quest into madness. One drawback is that it's about something impossible to explain, but they try to explain it anyway with a theory that doesn't make any sense. It's also crazy how they haven't had a single person return but still planned a two week hiking trip instead of just dipping their toes in. Natalie Portman is great in it. Oscar Isaac doesn't have to act at all and just sits there sweating. The soundtrack is great, especially in the lighthouse scene.",
