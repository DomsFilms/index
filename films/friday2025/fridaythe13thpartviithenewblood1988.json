	"review": "Tina and her telekinetic powers make this a more interesting story than what I've seen so far. I wouldn't go as far as to say the film has a message or purpose  though. There is just something interesting to watch between the killing scenes. Once again it is strangely tame in terms of violence, with almost every impalement hidden behind a cut or a reaction shot. Someone drops a Coca Cola bottle on a thick carpet and it completely shatters. One character is called Amanda Shepherd and I thought she introduced herself as Commander Shepherd at first.",
