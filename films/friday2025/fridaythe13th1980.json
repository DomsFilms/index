	"review": "This has aged in a very funny way. The budget is low, the corpses breathe when they're not hacked up mannequins, and there are some terrible line reads. The killer is comically incompetent once they're revealed, leaving you thinking how they could kill everyone else so easily and run around carrying their bodies. One actor does a horrible belly flop into the lake when someone needs saving, and they still used that take. A real snake is cruelly killed, and hopefully they only did one take there too. Anyway, it's time to talk about strip-monopoly. What a preposterous idea. You'd have to be wearing so many items of clothing for it to work at all. They're meant to be drunk and excited, but they take the time to get the board out and set everything up, sorting the cards and bills and laying them neatly around the board. Do they not realise a game of Monopoly usually lasts three hours and is not remotely fun after the first hour? It's a terrible game to play and there's no fun way to incorporate alcohol or nudity into it. Anyway the film kind of sucks, it doesn't do anything new or anything competent. It was very successful with a low budget and I can only imagine that's because of the nudity and a wave of word-of-mouth popularity among kids in the 80s who were too young for better contemporary films like {The Texas Chain Saw Massacre} and {The Shining}.",
