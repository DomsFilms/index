It's a fun tradition and I hope they keep it up in the newer ones where there are several years between each entry. Also, because I'm watching them so quickly, I don't need reminding about the previous film and can just look at my phone for the first few minutes. I'm typing this as it recaps the end of part 2 now! Ok, the movie has ended and I found it really stupid and funny, as though it's become a spoof of its own format. This was originally filmed and released in (red/blue) 3D and it is full of gimmicks where they waggle stuff in your face. They keep poking at you with broom handles and such, like in {Life of Pi}. The yo-yo shot and line read really made me laugh, as the most absurd example of this new level of comedy they found. The film was converted into 2D and re-released, at a cost that equalled the entire original production budget, so I assume the whole idea was a terrible mistake. I loved it, in a so-bad-it's good kind of way.",
