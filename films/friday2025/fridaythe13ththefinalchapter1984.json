	"review": "Ah, so this must be the final one! Crispin Glover is intense and strange as usual. This is one of his first feature films, so I assume he committed to his acting style as a teenager, having appeared on TV a few times. He really stands out, positively, against the usual bland characters in this franchise so far. In this one there are rather too many characters and I struggled to remember the relationships between them. The geography was hard to parse too, which is an issue when so much of the plot involves people running around looking for each other. There are some great kills, but they they don't build tension very effectively because the killings start early. Why am I scrutinising this so harshly compared to the previous one? It's because it isn't silly or funny enough to shut me up and keep me entertained. There's a very cheesy stunt with a person falling out of an upstairs window and landing on a car, that doesn't work at all. They barely make a dent in the roof of the car, and compressed gas shoots out of every window as they hit it.",
