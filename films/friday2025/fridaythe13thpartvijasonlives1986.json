	"review": "This is less grotesque, with a lot of cuts where you see a swiping blade and then a bloody body, without revelling in seeing a mannequin get stabbed. It is also not suspenseful, doesn't have any interesting characters, or a story, or any intrigue, stakes or motivations. Somehow, despite all this, I still enjoyed it. It's kind of funny and has some silly face close-ups almost like a Sam Raimi movie. There's a funny tiny gun, and another gun with a huge laser attached to it. There's an extremely low budget and unconvincing paintball scene. Tommy is back, but this time he has no personality for some reason. I am motivated to continue on with the series, but I hope they can reduce the number of kills to make time for some real storytelling.",
