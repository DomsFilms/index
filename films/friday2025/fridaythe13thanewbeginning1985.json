	"review": "I liked the distinctive and exaggerated characters. Some of the actors were trying very hard to be as zany as possible in the time they were given before they were killed. They really doubled down on tommy too, making him an hand-to-hand combat expert. Unfortunately the time is spread very thinly. In the first half there's a plotline about detectives who are investigating the murders, but when another one happens every five minutes they just can't afford any investigation scenes, and they're swept aside latter half. The whodunnit aspect is completely bungled by the end. I thought the production design, lighting and cinematography was better. It nails the dumb, entertaining nonsense tone that I want from the series, with grotesque kills and a bold but unsuccessful chainsaw fight scene.",
